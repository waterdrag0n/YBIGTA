       "'The Godfather \\n\\n\\n\\nFirst published in Great Britain 1922 \\nby William Heinemann Ltd \\nPRINTED AT MACMILLAN INDIA PRESS, MADRAS 600 002 \\n\\n\\n\\nFor .Anthof^ Cleri \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBook I \\n\\n\\nBehind every ff\\'eat fortune \\nthere is a crime. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER ONE \\n\\n\\nAmerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court \\nNumber 3 and waited for justice; vengeance on the men who \\nhad so cruelly hurt his daughter, who had tried to dishonour her. \\n\\nThe judge, a formidably heavy-featured man, rolled up the \\nsleeves of his black robe as if to physically chastise the two \\nyoung men standing before the bench. His face was cold with \\nmajestic contempt. But there was something fake in alfthis \\nthat Amerigo Bonasera sensed but did not yet understand. \\n\\n‘You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,* the judge \\nsaid harshly. Yes, yes, thought Amerigo Bonasera. Animak. \\nAnimak. l^e two young men, glossy hair crew cut, scrubbed \\nclean-cut faces composed into humble contrition, bowed their \\nheads in submksion. \\n\\n^The judge went on. ‘You acted like wild beasts in a jungle \\nand you are fortunate you did not sexually molest that poor \\ngirl or rd put you behind bars for twenty years.* The judge \\npaused, his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered \\nslyly towards the sallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera, then \\nlowered to a stack of probation reports befdre him. He \\nfrowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural \\ndesire. He spoke again. \\n\\n‘But because of yotir youth, your dean records, because of \\nyour fine families, and b^use the law in its majesty does not \\nseek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years’ con- \\nfinement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.* \\n\\nOnly forty years of profosional mourning I^t the over- \\nwhelming frustration a^ hatred from showing on Amerigo \\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\nBonasera’s face. His beautiful young daughter was still in the \\nhospital with her broken jaw wired together; and now these \\ntwo animaks went free? It had all been a farce. He watched the \\nhappy parents cluster around their darling sons. Oh, they \\nwere all happy now, they were smiling now. \\n\\nThe black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera’s throat, over- \\nflowed through tightly clenched teeth. He used his white linen \\npocket handkerchief and held it against his lips. He was stand- \\ning so when the two young men strode freely up the aisle, \\nconfident and cool-eyed, smiling, not giving him so much as a \\nglance. He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the \\nfresh linen against his mouth. \\n\\nThe parents of the animaks were coming by now, two men \\nand two women his age but more American in their dress. \\nThey glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, \\ntriumphant defiance. \\n\\nOut of control, Bonasera leaned forward towards the aisle \\nand shouted hoarsely, * You will weep as I have wept - I wiU \\nmake you weep as your children make me weep ’ - the linen at \\nhis eyes now. The defence attorneys bringing up the rear \\nswept their clients forward in a tight little band, enveloping \\nthe two young men, who had started back down the aisle as if \\nto protect their parents. A huge bailifiF moved quickly to block \\nthe row in which Bonasera stood. But it Was not necessary. \\n\\nAll his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera had trusted in \\nlaw and order. And he had prospered thereby! Now, though \\nhis brain smoked with hatred, though wild visions of buying a \\ngun and killing the two young men jangled the very bones of \\nhis skull, Bonasera turned to his still uncomprehending wife \\nand explained to her, *They have made fools of us.’ He paused \\nand thpn made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. *For \\njustice we must go on our knees to Don G>rleone.’ \\n\\nIn a garishly decorated Los Angeles hotel suite, Johnny \\nFontane was as jealously drunk as any ordinary husband. \\nSprawled on a red couch, he drank straight from the bottle of \\nScotch in his hand, then washed the taste away by dunking his \\nmouth in a crystalbucketoficecubes and water. It was four in the \\nmorning and he was spinning drunkenfimtasies of murdetinghis \\n\\n8 \\n\\n\\n\\ntrampy wife when she got home. If she ever did come home. It \\nwas too late to call his first wife and ask about the kids and \\nhe felt funny about calling any of his friends now that his career \\nwas plunging downhill. Hierchad becnatime when they would \\nhave been delighted, flattered by his calling them at four in the \\nmorning but now he bored them. He could even smile a little to \\nhimself as he thought that on ijic way up Johnny Fontanels tro- \\nubles had fascinated some of the greatest female stars in America. \\n\\nGulping at his bottle of Scotch, he heard finally his wife’s \\nkey in the door, but he kept drinking until she walked into the \\nroom and stood before him. She was to him so very beautiful, \\nthe angelic face, soulful violet eyes, the delicately fragile but \\nperfectly formed body. On the screen her beauty was magni- \\nfied, spiritualized. A hundred million men all over the world \\nwere in love with the face of Margot Ashton. And paid to see \\nit on the screen. \\n\\n* Where the hell were you?’ Johnny Fontane asked. \\n\\n* Out fucking,’ she said. \\n\\nShe had misjudged his drunkenness. He sprang over the \\ncocktai) table and grabbed her by the throat. But close up to \\nthat magical face, the lovely violet eyes, he lost his anger and \\nbecame . helpless again. She made the mistake of smiling \\nmockingly, saw his fist draw back. She screamed, ^Johnny, not \\nin the face, I’m making a picture.’ \\n\\nShe was laughing. He punched her in the stomach and .she \\nfell to the floor. He fell bn top of her. He could smell her \\nfragrant breath as she gasped for air. He punched her on the \\narms and on the thigh muscles of her silky tanned legs. He \\nbeat her as he had beaten snott^^maller kids long ago when he \\nhad been a tough teenager in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen. A \\npainful punishment that would leave no lasting dis^guremenr \\nof loosened teeth or broken nose. \\n\\nBut he was not bitting her hard enough. He couldn’t. And \\nshe \\'was giggling at him. Spread-eagl^ on the floor, her \\nbrocaded gown hitched up atove her thighs, she taunted him \\nbetween giggles. *Comc on, stick it in. Stick it in, Johnny, \\nthat’s what you really want.’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontane got up. He hated the woman on the floor, \\nbut her beauty was a magic shield. Margot rolled away, and tn \\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\na daticer’s spring was on her feet £icing him. She went into a \\nchildish mocking dance and chanted^ * Johnny never hurt me, \\nJohnny never hurt me.* Then almost sadly with grave beauty \\nshe said, ‘You poor silly bastard, giving me cramps like a kid. \\nAh, Johnny, you always will be a dumb romantic guinea, you \\neven make love like a Idd. You still think screwing is really like \\nthose dopey songs you used to sing.* She shook her head smd \\nsaid, ‘Poor Johnny. Goodbye, Johnny.* She walked into the \\nbedroom and he heard her turn the key in the lock. \\n\\nJohnny sat on the floor with his fltce in his hands. The sick, \\nhumiliating despair overwhelmed him. And then the gutter \\ntoughness that had helped him survive the jungle of Holly- \\nwood made him pick up the phone and call for a car to take \\nhim to the airport. There was one person who could save \\nhim. He would go back to New York. He would go back to \\nthe one man with the power, the wisdom, he needed and a love \\nhe still trusted. His Godfather Corleone. \\n\\nThe baker, Na 2 orine, pudgy and crusty as his great Italian \\nloaves, still dusty with flour, scowled at his wife, his nubile \\ndaughter, Katherine, and his baker’s helper, Enao. Bozo had \\nchanged into his prisoner-of-war uniform with its green- \\nlettered armband and was terrified that this scene would make \\nhim late reporting back to Governor’s Island. One of the \\nmany thousands of Italian Army prisoners paroled daily to \\nwork in the American economy, he lived in constant fear of \\nthat parole being revoked. And so the* little comedy being \\nplay^ now \\'was, for him, a serious business. \\n\\nNazorine asked fiercely, ‘Have you dishonoured my fiunily? \\nHave you given my daughter a litde package to remember you \\nby npw that the war is over and you know America will Idck \\nyour ass back to your village full of shit in Sicily?* \\n\\nEnzo, a very short, strongly built boy, put his hmd oirer his \\nheart and said almost in tears, yet clevedy, *Padram^ Iswcatrhy \\nthe Holy Virgin I have never taken advantage of your kind- \\nness. 1 love your daughter with all reQ>ect. 1 asl^ for her \\nband widi all respect. 1 know 1 have no right, but if they send \\nme back to Italy I can never come back to America. 1 will \\nnever be able to marry Katherine.* \\n\\n\\nlO \\n\\n\\n\\nNa2odne*s wife, Filomena, spoke to the point. ‘ Stop all this \\nfoolishness/ she said to her pudgy husband. * You know what \\nyou must, do. Keep Enzo here, send him to hide with our \\ncousins in Long Island.’ \\n\\nKatherine was weeping. She was already plump, homely, and \\nsprouting a faint moustache. She would never get a husband as \\nIiandsome as Enzo, never find another man who touched her \\nbody in secret places with such respectful love. ‘ I’ll go and live \\nin Italy,’ she screamed at her father. ‘I’ll run away if you don’t \\nkeep Enzo here.’ \\n\\nNazorine glanced at her shrewdly. She was a ‘hot number’ \\nthis daughter of his. He had seen her brush her swelling \\nbuttocks .against Enzo’s front when the baker’s helper \\nsqueezed behind her to fill the counter baskets with hot loaves \\nfrom the oven. The young rascal’s hot loaf would be in \\noven, Nazorine thought lewdly, if proper steps were not \\ntaken. Enzo must be kept in America and be made an American \\ncitizen. And there was only one man who could arrange $uch \\nan afEsir, The Godfather. Don Corleone. \\n\\nAll of these people and many others received engraved \\ninvitations to the wedding of Miss Constanzia Corleone, to be \\ncelebrated on the last Saturday in August 1945. The father of \\nthe bride, Don Vito Corleone, never forgot his old friends and \\nneighbours though he himself now lived in a huge house on \\nLong Island. The reception would be held in that house and \\nthe festivities would go on all day. There was no doubt it \\nwould be a momentous occasion. Ihe war with the Japanese \\nhad just ended, so there would not be any nagging fear for \\ntheir sons fighting in the Army to cloud these festivities. A \\nwedding was just what people needed to show their joy. . \\n\\nAnd so on that Saturday morning the friends of Don Cor* \\nleone streamed out of New York City to do him honour. They \\nbore cream-coloured envelopes stuffed with cash as bridal \\ngifts, no cheques. Inside each envelope a card established the \\nidentity of the giver and the measure of his respect for the \\nGodfiither. A respect truly earned. \\n\\nDon Vito torlcone was a man to whom everybody came \\nfor help, and never were they disappointed. He made no \\n\\n\\nII \\n\\n\\n\\nempty promises, nor the craven excuse that bis hands were \\ntied by more powerful forces in the world than himself. It was \\nnot necessary that he be your friend, it was not even important \\nthat you had no means with which to repay him. Only one \\nthing was required. That you, joh ytutrseJf^ proclaim your \\nfriendship. And then, no matter how poor or powerless the \\nsupplicant, Don Corleone would take that man\\'s troubles to \\nhis heart. And he would let nothing stand in the way to a \\nsolution of that man’s woe. His reward? Friendship, the \\nrespectful title of ‘Don*, and sometimes the more affectionate \\nsalutation of ‘Godfather’. And perhaps, to show respect only, \\nnever for profit, some humble gift - a gallon of homemade \\nwine or a basket of peppered iarclUs specially baked to grace \\nhis Christmas table. It was understo^ it was mete good \\nmanners, to proclaim that you were in his debt and that he \\nhad the right to call upon you at any time to redeem your \\ndebt by some small service. \\n\\nNow on this great day, his daughter’s wedding day, Don \\nVito Corleone stood in the doorway of his Long Beach home \\nto greet his guests, all of them known, all of them trusted. \\nMany of them owed their good fortune in life to the Don and \\non this intimate occasion felt free to call him ‘Godfather’ to \\nhis face. Even the people performing festal services were his \\nfriends. The bartender was an old comrade whose gift was all \\nthe wedding liqueurs and his own expert skills. The waiters \\nwere the friends of Don Corleone’s sons. The food on the \\ngarden picnic tables had been cooked by the Don’s wife and \\nher friends, and the gaily festooned one-acre garden itself had \\nbeen decorated by the young girl-chums of the bride. \\n\\nDon Corleone received everyone - rich and poor, powerful \\nand humble - with an equal show of love. He slighted no one. \\nThat was his character. And the guests so exclaimed at bow \\nwell he looked in his tux that an inexperienced observer might \\neasily have thought the Don himself was the lucky groom. \\n\\nStanding at the door with him were two of his three sons. \\nThe eldest, baptized Santino but called Sonny by everyone \\nexcept his father, was looked at askance by the older Italian \\nmen; with admiration by the younger. Sonny Corleone was \\ntall for a first-generation American of Italian parentage. \\n\\n\\n12 \\n\\n\\n\\nalmost six feet, and his crop of bushy, curly hair made liim \\nlook even taller. His face was that of a gross Cupid, the \\nfeatures even but the bow-shaped lips thickly sensual, the \\ndimpled cleft chin in some curious way obscene. He was built \\nas powerfully as a bull, and it was common knowledge that he \\nwas so generously endowed by nature that his martyred wife \\nfeared the marriage bed as unbelievers once feared the rack. \\nIt was whispered that when as a youth he had visited houses of \\niU fame, even the most hardened and fearless putain^ after an \\nawed inspection of his massive organ, demanded double \\nprice. \\n\\nHere at the wedding feast, some young matrons, wide- \\nhipped, wide-mouthed, measured Sonny Corleonc with cooDy \\nconfident eyes. But on this particular day they were wasting \\ntheir time. Sonny Corleone, despite the presence of his wife \\nand three small children, had plans for his sister’s maid of \\nhonour, Lucy Mancini. This young girl, fully aware, sat at a \\ngarden table iti her pink formal gown, a tiara of dowers in her \\nglossy black hair. She had dirted with Sonny in the past week \\nof rehearsals and squeezed his hand that morning at the altar. \\nA maiden could do no more. \\n\\nShe did not care that he ^ ould never be the great man his \\nfather had proved to be. Sonny Corleonc had strength, he had \\ncourage. He was generous and his heart was admitted to be as \\nbig as his organ. Yet he did not have his father’s humility but \\ninstead a quick, hot temper that led him into errors of judge- \\nment. Though he was a great help in his father’s business, \\nthere were many who doubted that he would become the \\nheir to it. \\n\\nThe second son, Frcdcrico, called Fred or Frtdo, was a \\nchild every Italian prayed to the saints for. Dutiful, loyal, \\nalways at the service of Us father, living with his patents at age \\nthirty. He was short and burly, not handsome but with the \\nsame Cupid head of the famOy, the curly helmet of hair over \\nthe round face and sensual bow-shaped Kps. Only, in Fred, \\nthese lips were not sensual but graniteKke. Inclined to dour- \\nness, he was stiU a crutch to his &ther, never disputed him, \\nnever embarrassed him by scandalous behaviour with women. \\nDespite all these virtues, he did not have that personal \\n\\n15 \\n\\n\\n\\nmagnetism, that animal force, so necessary for a leader of men, \\nand he, too, was not expected to inherit the family business. \\n\\nThe third son, Michael Corleone, did not stand with his \\nfather and his two brothers but sat at a table in the most \\nsecluded corner of the garden. But even there he could not \\nescape the attentions of the family friends. \\n\\nMichael Corleone was the youngest son of the Don and the \\nonly child who had refused the great man’s direction. He did \\nnot have the heavy, Cupid-shaped face of the other children, \\nand. his jet black hair was straight rather than curly. His skin \\nwas a clear olive-brown that would have been called beautiful \\nin a girl. He was handsome in a delicate way. Indeed there had \\nbeen a time when the Don had worried about his youngest \\nson’s masculinity. A worry that was put to rest when Michael \\nCorleone became seventeen years old. \\n\\nNow this youngest son sat at a table in the extreme comer \\nof the garden to proclaim his chosen alienation from father \\nand family. Beside him sat the American girl everyone had \\nheard about but whom no one had seen until this day. He had, \\nof course, shown the proper respect and introduced her to \\neveryone at the wedding, including his family. They were not \\nimpressed with her. She was too thin, she was too fair, her \\nface was too sharply intelligent for a woman, her manner too \\nfree for a maiden. Her name, too, was outlandish to their \\nears ; she called herself Kay Adams. If she had told them that \\nher family had settled in America two hundred years ago and \\nher name was a common one, they would have shrugged. \\n\\nEvery guest noticed that the Don paid no particular atten- \\ntion to this third son. Michael had been hiS favourite before \\nthe vfar and obviously the chosen heir to run the family \\nbusiness when the proper moment came. He had all the quiet \\nforce and intelligence of his great father, the born instinct to \\nact in such a way that men had no recourse but to respect him. \\nBut when World War II broke out, Michael Corleone volun- \\nteered for the Marine Corps. He defied his father’s express \\ncommand when he did so. \\n\\nDon Corleone had no desire, no intention, of letdng his \\nyoungest son be killed in the service of a power foreign to \\nhims^. Doctors had been bribed, secret arrangements had \\n\\nM \\n\\n\\n\\nbeen made. A gteat deal of money had been spent to take*the \\nproper precautions. But Midbael was twenty-one years of age \\nand nothing could be done against his own wilfulness. He \\nenlisted and fought over the Pacific Ocean. He became a \\nCaptain and won medals. In 1944 his picture was printed in \\nUft magazine with a \\'photo layout of his deeds. A friend had \\nshown Don Corleone the magazine (his family did not dare), \\nand the Don had grunted disdainfully and said, ‘ He performs \\nthose miracles for strangers.’ \\n\\nWhen Michael Corleone was discharged early in 1945 to \\nrecover from a disabling wound he had no idea that his father \\nhad arranged his release. He stayed home for a few weeks, \\nthen, without consulting anyone, entered Dartmouth College \\nin Hanover, New Hampshire, and so he left his father’s house. \\nTo return for the wedding of his sister and to show his own \\nfuture wife to them, the washed-out rag of an American girl. \\n\\nMichael Corleone was amusing Kay Adams by telling her \\nUttle stories about some of the more colourful wedding guests. \\nHe was, in turn, amused by her finding these people exotic, \\nand, as always, charmed by her intense interest in anything \\nnew and foreign to her experience. Finally her attention was \\ncaught by a small group of men gathered around a wooden \\nbarrel of homemade wine. The men were Amerigo Bonasera, \\nNazorine the baker, Anthony Coppola, and Luca Brasi. With \\nher usual alert intelligence she remarked on the fact that these \\nfour men did not seem particularly happy. Michael smiled. \\n\\n•No, they’re not,’ he said. ^They’re waiting to see my father \\nin private. They have favours to ask.’ And indeed it was easy to \\nsee that all four men constantly followed the Don with their eyes. \\n\\nAs Don Corleone stood greeting guests, a black Chevrolet \\nsedan came to a stop on the far side of the paved mall. Two \\nmen in the front seat puUed notebooks from their jackets and, \\nwith no attempt at concealment, jotted down licence numbers \\nof the other cars parked around tne mall. Sonny turned to his \\nfather and said, ‘Those guys over there must be cops.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone shrugged. ‘1 don’t own the street. They can \\ndo what they please.’ \\n\\nSonny’s heavy Cupid fyot grew ted with anger. ‘Those \\n\\n\\n\\nlousy bastards, they don’t respect anything.* He left the steps \\nof the house and walked across the mall to where the black \\nsedan was parked. He thrust his face angrily close to the face \\nof the driver, who did not flinch but flapped open his wallet \\nto show a green identification card. Sonny stepped back \\nwithout saying a word. He spat so that the spittle hit the back \\ndoor of the sedan and walked away. He was hoping the driver \\nwould get out of the sedan and come after him, on the mall, \\nbut nothing happened. When he reached the steps he said to \\nhis father, ‘Those guys arc FBI men. They’re taldng down all \\nthe licence numbers. Snotty bastards.’ \\n\\nDon Corlcone knew who they were. His closest and most \\nintimate friends had been advised to attend the wedding in \\nautomobiles not their own. And though he disapproved of his \\nson’s foolish displa^^ of auger, the tantrum served a purpose. It \\nwould convince the interlopers that their presence was un- \\nexpected and unprepared for. So Don Corlcone himself was \\nnot angry. He had long ago learned that society imposes \\ninsults that must be borne, comforted by the knowledge that \\nin this world there comes a time when the most humble of \\nmen, if he keeps his eyes open, can take his revenge on the \\nmost powerful. It was this knowledge that prevented the Don \\nfrom losing the humility all his friends admired in him. \\n\\nBut now in the garden behind the house, a four-piece band \\nbegan to play. All the guests had arrived. Don Corlcone put the \\nintruders out of his mind and led his two sons to the wedding \\nfeast. \\n\\nThere were, now, hundreds of guests in the huge garden, \\nsome dancing on the wooden platform bedecked with fl.owcrs, \\nothers\\' sitting at long tables piled high with spicy food and \\ngallon jugs of black, homemade wine. The bride, Connie \\nCorlcone, sat in splendour at a special raised table with her \\ngroon\\\\ the maid of honour, bridesmaids, and ushers. It was a \\nrustic setting in the old Italian style. Not to the bride’s taste, but \\nConnie had consented to a ‘ guinea ’ wedding to please her father \\nbecause she had so displeasured him in her choice of a husband. \\n\\nThe groom. Carlo Rixzi, was a half-breed, bom of a Sicilian \\nfiither and the North Italian mother from whom he had \\n\\ni6 \\n\\n\\n\\ninherited his blond hair and blue eyes. His parents li^ed in \\nNevada and Carlo had left that state because of a little trouble \\nwith the law. In New York he met Sonny Corleone and so met \\nthe sister. Don Corleone, of course, sent trusted friends to \\nNevada and they reported that Carlo’s police trouble was a \\nyouthful indiscretion with a gun, not serious, that could \\neasily be wiped off the books to leave the youth with a dean \\nrecord. They also came back with detailed information on legal \\ngambling in Nevada which greatly interested the Don and \\nwhich he had been pondering over since. It was part of the \\nDon\\'s greatness that he profited from everything. \\n\\nConnie Corleone was a not quite pretty girl, thin and \\nnervous and certain to become shrewish later in life. But \\ntoday, transformed by her white bridal gown and eager \\nvirginity, she was so radiant as to be almost beautiful. Beneath \\nthe wooden table her hand rested on the muscular thigh of her \\ngroom. Her Cupid-bow mouth pouted to give him an airy \\nUss. \\n\\nShe thought him incredibly handsome. Carlo Rizzi had \\nworked in the open desert air while very young - heavy \\nlabourer’s work. Now he had tremendous forearms and his \\nshoulders bulged the jacket of his tux. He basked in the \\nadoring eyes of his bride and filled her glass with wine. He \\nwas elaborately courteous to her as if they were both actors in \\na play. But his eyes kept flickering towards the huge silk purse \\nthe bride wore on her right shoulder and whic^ was now \\nstuffed full of money envelopes. How much did it hold? Ten \\nthousand? Twenty thousand? Carlo Rizzi smiled. It was only \\nthe beginning. He had, after all, married into a royal family. \\nThey would have to take cate of him. , \\n\\nIn the crowd of guests a dapper young man with the sleek \\nhead of a ferret was also studying the silk purse. From sheer \\nhabit Paulie Gatto wondered just how he could go about \\nhijacking that fat pocketbook. The idea amused him. But he \\nknew it was idle, innocent dreaming, as small children dream \\nof knocking out tanks with pop-guns. He watched his boss, fat, \\nmiddle-aged Peter Qemenza whiding young girls around the \\nwooden dance floor in a rustic and lusty TaranttUa, Qemenza, \\nimmensely tall, immensely huge, danced with such skill and \\n\\n\\n\\nabandon, his hard belly lecherously bumping the breasts of \\nyounger, tinier women, that all the guests were applauding \\nhim. Older women grabbed his arm to become his next \\npartner. The younger men respectfully cleared off the floor and \\nclapped their hands in time to the mandolin’s wild strumming. \\nWhen Qemenaa finally collapsed in a chair, Paulie Gatto \\nbrought him a glass of icy. black wine and wiped the per- \\nspiring Jovelike brow with his silk handkerchief. Clemenaa \\nwas blowing like a whale as he gulped down the wine. But \\ninstead of thanking Paulie he said curtly, * Never mind being a \\ndance judge, do your job. Take a walk around the neighbour- \\nhood and see everything is OK.’ Paulie slid away into the \\ncrowd. \\n\\nThe band took a refreshment break. A young man named \\nNino Valenti picked up a discarded mandolin, put his left foot \\nup on a chair, and began to sing a coarse Sicilian love song. \\nNino Valenti’s face was handsome though bloated by con- \\ntinual drinking and he was already a little drunk. He rolled his \\neyes as his tongue caressed the obscene lyrics. The women \\nshrieked with glee and the men shouted the last word of each \\nstanza with the singer. \\n\\nDon Corleone, notoriously straitlaced in such matters, \\nthough his stout wife was screaming jo3rfully with the others, \\ndisappeared tactfully into the house. Seeing this. Sonny \\nCorleone made his way to the bride*s table and sat down \\nbeside young Lucy Mancini, the maid of honour. They were \\nsafe. His wife was in the kitchen putting the last touches on the \\nserving of the wedding cake. Sonny whispered a few words in \\nthe young girl’s ear and she rose. Sonny waited a few minutes \\nand then casually followed her, stopping to talk with a guest \\nhere and there as he worked his way through the crowd. \\n\\nAll eyes followed them. The maid of honour, thoroughly \\nAmericanized by three years of college, was a ripe girl who \\nalready had a ‘reputation*. All through the marriage re- \\nhearsals she had flirted with Sonny Corleone in a teasing, \\njoking way she thought was permitted because he was the best \\nman and her wedding partner. Now holding her pink gown up \\noff the ground, Lucy Mancini went into the house, smiling \\nwith false innocence, ran lightly up the stairs to ^e bath- \\n\\n18 \\n\\n\\n\\nroom. She stayed there for a few moments. When she came out \\nSonny Cotkone was on the landing above, beckoning her \\nupward. \\n\\nFrom behind the closed window of Don Codeone’s * ofiice\\', \\na slightly raised corner room, Thomas Hagen watched the \\nwedding party in the festooned garden. The walls behind \\nhim were stacked with law books. Hagen was the Don’s \\nlawyer and acting Consigiiori^ or counsellor, and as such held \\nthe most vital subordinate position in the family business* He \\nand die Don had solved many a knotty problem in this room, \\nand so when he saw the Gc^ather leave the festiviues and \\nenter the house, he knew, wedding or no, there would be a \\nlitde work this day. The Don would be coming to see him. \\nThen Hagen saw Sonny Corleone whisper in Lucy Mancini’s \\near and their litde comedy as he followed her into the house. \\nHagen grimaced, debated whether to inform the Don, and \\ndecided against it. He went to the desk and picked up a hand- \\nwritten list of the people who had been granted permission to \\nsee Don Corleone privately. When the Don entered the room \\nHagen handed him the list. Don Corleone nodded and said, \\n’Leave Bonasera to the end. ’ \\n\\nHagen used the french doors and went directly out into the \\ngarden to where the supplicants clustered around the barrel of \\nwine. He pointed to the baker, the pudgy Nazorine. \\n\\nDon Corleone greeted the baker with an embrace. They had \\nplayed together as children in Italy and had grown up in \\nfriendship. Every Easter freshly baked clotted-cheese and \\nwheat-germ pies, their crusts yolk-gold, big around as truck \\nwheels, surrived at Don Corleone’s home. On Christmas, on \\nfiunily birthdays, rich creamy pastries proclaimed* the Nazo- \\nrines* respect. And all through the years, lean and fat, Nazo- \\nrine cheerfully paid his dues to the l^ery union organized by \\nthe Don in his salad days. Never asking for a favour in return \\nexcept for the chance to buy black-market OPA sugar \\ncoupons during the war. Now the time had come for the baker \\nto oaim his rights as a loyal friend, and Don Corleone looked \\nforward \\'4rith great pleasure to granting his request. \\n\\nHe gave the baker a Di Nobili cigar and a glass of ydlow \\nStt^and put his hand on the man’s shotdder to urge him on. \\n\\n\\n19 \\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the mark of the Don’s humanity. He knew from \\nbitter experience what courage it took to ask a favour from a \\nfellow man. \\n\\nThe baker told the story of his daughter and Enzo. A fine \\nItalian lad from Sicily; captured by the American Army; sent \\nto the United States as a prisoner of war; given parole to help \\nour war effort! A pure and honourable love had sprung up \\nbetween honest Enzo and his sheltered Katherine, but now \\nthat the war was ended the poor lad would be repatriated to \\nItaly and Nazorine’s daughter would surely die of a broken \\nheart. Only Godfather Corleone could help this afflicted \\ncouple. He was their last hope. \\n\\nThe Don walked Nazorine up and down the room, his hand \\non the baker’s shoulder, his head nodding with understanding \\nto keep up the man’s courage. When the baker had finished \\nDon Corleone smiled at him and said, ‘ My dear friend, put all \\nyour worries aside.’ He went on to explain very carefully what \\nmust be done. The Congressman of the district must be \\npetitioned. The Congressman would propose a special bill that \\nwould allow Enzo to become a citizen. The bill would surely \\npass Congress. A privilege all those rascals extended to each \\nother. Don Corleone explained that this would cost money, \\nthe going price was now two thousand dollars. He, Don \\nCorleone, would guarantee performance and accept payment. \\nDid his friend agree? \\n\\nThe baker nodded his head vigorously. He did not expect \\nsuch a great favour for nothing. That was understood. A \\nspecial Act of Congress docs not come cheap. Nazorine was \\nalmost tearful in his thanks. Don Corleone walked him to the \\ndoor, assuring him that competent people would be sent to the \\nbakery*to arrange all details, complete all necessary documents. \\nThe baker embraced him before disappearing into the \\ngarden. \\n\\nHagen smiled at the Don. ‘That’s a good investment for \\nNazorine. A son-in-law and a cheap lifetime helper in his \\nbakery all for two thousand dollars.’ He paused. ‘Who do I \\ngive this job to?* \\n\\nDon Corleone frowi^d in thought. ‘Nor to our paisan. Give \\nit to the Jew in the next district. Have the home addresses \\n\\n\\nao \\n\\n\\n\\nchanged. 1 think thete might be many such cases now the war \\nis over; we should have extra people in Washington that can \\nhandle the overflow and not raise the price.’ Hagen made a \\nnote on his pad. ‘Not Congressman Luteco. Try Fischer.’ \\n\\nThe next man Hagen brought in was a very simple case. His \\nname was Anthony Coppola and he was the son of a man Don \\nCorleone had worked with in the railroad yards in his youth. \\nCoppola needed five hundred dollars to open a pizzeria ; for a \\ndeposit on fixtures and the special oven. For reasons not \\ngone into, credit was not available. The Don reached into his \\npocket and took out a roll of bills. It was not quite enough. He \\ngrimaced and said to Tom Hagen, ‘Loan me a hundred \\ndollars, I’ll pay you back Monday when I go to the bank.’ The \\' \\nsupplicant protested that four hundred dollars would be \\nample, but Don Corleone patted his shoulder, saying, apolo- \\ngetically, ‘This fancy wedding left me a little short of cash.’ \\nHe took the money Hagen extended to him and gave it to \\nAnthony Coppola with his own roll of bills. \\n\\nHagen watched with quiet admiration. The Don always \\ntaught that when a man was generous, he must show the \\ngenerosity as personal. How flattering to Anthony Coppola \\nthat a man like the Don would borrow to loan him money. Not \\nthat Coppola did not know that the Don was a millionaire, but \\nhow many millionaires let themselves be put to even a small \\ninconvenience by a poor friend? \\n\\nThe Don raised his head inquiringly. Hagen said, ‘He’s not \\non the h\\'st but Luca Brasi wants to see you. He understands it \\ncan’t be public but he wants to congratulate you in person.’ \\n\\nFor the first time the Don seemed displeased. The answer \\nwas devious. ‘Is it necessary?’ he asked. , \\n\\nHagen shrugged. ‘You understand him better than I do. \\nBut he was very grateful that you invited him to the wedding. \\nHe never expected that. I think he wants to show his gratitude.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone nodded and gestured that Luca Brasi should \\nbe brought to him. \\n\\nIn the garden Kay Adams was struck by the violet fury \\nimprinted on the face of Luca Brasi. She asked about him. \\nMichael had brought Kay to the wedding so that she would \\nslowly, and perhaps without too much of a shock, absorb the \\n\\n\\n21 \\n\\n\\n\\ntnith about his father. But so fat she seemed to regard the \\nDon as a slightly unethical businessman. Michael decided to \\ntell her part of the truth indirectly. He explained that Luca \\nBrasi was one of the most feared men in the Eastern under- \\nworld. His great talent, it was said, was that he could do a job \\nof murder all by himself, without confederates, which auto- \\nmatically made discovery and conviction by the law almost \\nimpossible. Michael grimaced and said, don’t know whether \\nall that stuff is true. I do know he is sort of a friend to my \\nBither.’ \\n\\nFor the first time Kay began to understand. She asked a little \\nincredulously, * You’re not hinting that a man like that works \\nfor your father?’ \\n\\nllie heU with it, he thought. He said, straight out, ‘Nearly \\nfifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father’s \\noil importing business. They tried to kill him and nearly did. \\nLuca Brasi went after them. The story is that he killed six men \\nin two weeks and that ended the famous olive oil war.’ He \\nsmiled as if it were a joke. \\n\\nKay shuddered. ‘You mean your father was shot by \\ngangsters?’ \\n\\n‘Fifteen years ago,’ Michael said. ‘Everything’s been peace- \\nful since then.’ He was afraid he had gone too far. \\n\\n‘You\\'re trying to scare me,’ Kay said. ‘You just don’t want \\nme to marry you.’ She smiled at him and poked his ribs with \\nher elbow. ‘Very clever.’ \\n\\nMichael smiled back at her. ‘1 want you to think about it,’ he \\nsaid. \\n\\n‘Did he really kill six men?’ Kay asked. \\n\\n‘That’s what the newspapers claimed,’ Mike said. ‘Nobody \\never proved it. But there’s another story about him that \\nnobody ever tells. It’s supposed to be so terrible that even my \\nfather won’t talk about it. Tom Hagen knows the story and he \\nwon’t tell me. Once I kidded him, 1 said, “When will I be old \\nenough to hear that story about Luca?’’ and Tom said, “When \\nyou’re a hundred.”\\' Michael sipped his glass of wine. ‘That \\nmust be some story. That must be some Luca.’ \\n\\nLuca Brasi was indeed a man to frighten the devil in hell \\nhimself. Short, squat, massive-skulled, his presence sent out \\n\\n\\n22 \\n\\n\\n\\naknn bdb of danger. HU &ce vas stamped into a mask of \\nfury. The eyes were brown but with none of the warmth \\nof that colour, more a deadly tan. The mouth was not so \\nmuch cruel as lifeless; thin, rubbery, and the colour of \\nveal. \\n\\nBrasi’s reputation for violence was awesome and his devo- \\ntion to Don Corleone legendary. He was, in himself, one of the \\ngreat blocks that supported the Don’s power structure. His \\nkind was a rarity. \\n\\nLuca Brasi did not feat the police, he did not fear society, he \\ndid not fear God, he did not fear hell, he did not fear or love \\nhis fellow man. Put he had elected, he had chostn^ to fear and \\nlove I>on Corleone. Ushered into the presence of the Don, the \\nterrible Brasi held himself sti£F with respect. He stuttered over \\nthe flowery congratulations he offered and his formal hope \\nthat the first grandchild would be masculine. He then handed \\nthe Don an envelope stuffed with cash as a gift for the bridal \\ncouple. \\n\\nSo that was what he wanted to do. Hagen noticed the \\nchange in Don Corleone. The Don received Brasi as a king \\ngreets a subject who has done him an enormous service, never \\nfiimiliar but with regal respect. With every gesture, with every \\nword, Don Corleone made it clear to Luca Brasi that he was \\npahtid. Not for one moment did he show surprise at the \\nwedding gift being presented to him personally. He under- \\nstood. \\n\\nThe money in the envelope was sure to be more than anyone \\nelse had given. Brasi had spent many hours deciding on the \\nsum, comparing it to what the other guests might offer. He \\nwanted to be the most generous to show that he h^d the most \\nrespect, and that was why he had given his envdope to the \\nDon personally, a gauchc^e the Don overlooked in his own \\nflowery sentence of thanks. Hagen saw Luca Brasi’s face lose \\nits mask of fury, swell with pdde and pleasiire, Brasi kissed the \\nDon’s hand before he went out the door that Hagen held \\nopen. Hagen prudently gave Brasi a fdendly smile which the \\nsquat man admowledged with a polite stretdung of rubbery, \\nveal-coloured lips. \\n\\n^ When the door closed Don Corleone gave a small sigh of \\n\\n*1 \\n\\n\\n\\nrelief. Brasi was the only man in the world who could make \\nhim nervous. The man was like a natural force, not truly \\nsubject to control. He had to be handled as gingerly as dyna- \\nmite. The Don shrugged. Even dynamite could be exploded \\nharmlessly if the need arose. He looked qucstioningly at \\nHagen. \\'Is Bonasera the only one left?’ \\n\\nHagen nodded. Don Corleone frowned in thought, then \\nsaid, ‘ Before you bring him in, teU Santino to come here. He \\nshould learn some things.* \\n\\nOut in the garden, Hagen searched anxiously for Sonny \\nCorleone. He told the waiting Bonasera to be patient and went \\nover to Michael Corleone and his girlfriend. ‘Did you sec \\nSonny around?’ he asked. Michael shook his head. Damn, \\nHagen thought, if Sonny was screwing the maid of honour all \\nthis time there was going to be a mess of trouble. His wife, the \\nyoung girl’s family; it could be a disaster. Anxiously he \\nhurried to the entrance through which he had seen Sonny \\ndisappear almost a half hour ago. \\n\\nSeeing Hagen go into the house, Kay Adams asked Michael \\nCorleone, *Who is he? You introduced him as your brother, \\nbut his name is different and be certainly doesn’t look Italian.’ \\n\\n‘Tom lived with us since he was twelve years old,’ Michael \\nsaid. ‘His parents died and he was roaming around the streets \\nwith this bad eye infection. Sonny brought him home one \\nnight and he just stayed. He didn’t have any place to go. He \\nlived with us until he got married.’ \\n\\nKay Adams was thrilled. ‘That’s really romantic,’ she said. \\n‘Your father must be a warmhearted person. To adopt some- \\nbody just like that when he had so many children of his own.’ \\n\\nMichael didn’t bother to point out that immigrant Italians \\nconsidered four children a smaU family. He merely said, \\'Tom \\nwasn’t adopted. He just lived with us.’ \\n\\n‘Oh,’ Kay said, then asked curiously, ‘why didn’t you adopt \\nhim?’ \\n\\nMichael laughed. ‘Because my father said it would be dis- \\nrespectful for Tom to change his name. Disrespectful to his \\nown parents.’ \\n\\nThey saw Hagen shoo Sonny through the french door into \\nthe Don’s office and then crook a finger at Amerigo Bonasera. \\n\\n\\nM \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Why do they bother your father with business on a day like \\nthis?’ Kay asked. \\n\\nMichael laughed again. \\' Because they know that by tradition \\nno Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter’s wedding \\nday. And no Sicilian erer lets a chance like that go by.’ \\n\\nLucy Manciiii lifted her pink gown oH^ the floor and ran up \\nthe steps. Sonny Corleone’s heavy Cupid face, redly obscene \\nwith winey lust, frightened her, but she had teased him for the \\npast week to just this end. In her two college love affairs she \\nhad felt nothing and neither of them lasted more than a week. \\nQuarrelling, her second lover had mumbled something about \\nher being \\'too big down there’. Lucy had understood and for \\nthe rest of the school term had reused to go out on any \\ndates. \\n\\nDuring the summer, preparing for the wedding of her best \\nfriend, Connie Corleone, Lucy heard the whispered stories \\nabout Sonny. One Sunday afternoon in the Corleone kitchen. \\nSonny’s wife Sandra gossiped freely. Sandra was a coarse, \\ngood-natured woman who had been born in Italy but brought \\nto America as a small child. She was strongly built with great \\nbreasts and had already borne three children in five years of \\nmarriage. Sandra and the other women teased Connie about \\nthe terrors of the nuptial bed. *My God,’ Sandra had giggled, \\n\\'when I saw that pole of Sonny’s for the first time and realized \\nhe was going to stick it into I yelled bloody murder. After \\nthe first year my insides felt as mushy as macaroni boiled for \\nan hour. When I heard he was doing the job on other girls I \\nwent to church and lit a candle.’ \\n\\nThey had all laughed, but Lucy had felt her flesh twitching \\nbetween her legs. \\n\\nNow as she ran up the steps towards Sonny a tremendous \\nflash of desire went through her body. On the landing Sonny \\ngrabbed her hand and pulled her down the hall into an empty \\ni^droom. Her legs went weak as the door dosed behind them. \\nShe fdt Sonny’s moudi on hers, his lips tasting of burnt \\ntobacco, bitter. She opened her mouth. At that moment she \\nfelt his hand come up beneath her bridesmaid’s gown, heard \\ndie rusde of material giving way, fidt his large warm hand \\n\\n\\n*5 \\n\\n\\n\\nbetween her legs, tipping aside the satin panties to caress her \\nvulva. She put her arms around his neck and hung there as he \\nopened his trousers. Then be placed both hands beneath her \\nbare buttocks and lifted her. She gave a little hop in the air so \\nthat both her legs were wrapped around his upper thighs. His \\ntongue was in her mouth and she sucked on it. He gave a \\nsavage thrust that banged her head against the door. She felt \\nsomething burning pass between her thighs. She let her right \\nhand drop from his neck and reached down to guide him . \\nHer hand closed around an enormous, blood-gorged pole of \\nmuscle. It pulsated in her hand like an animal and almost \\nweeping with grateful ecstasy she pointed it into her own wet, \\nturgid flesh. The thrust of its entering, the unbelievable \\npleasure made her gasp, brought her legs up almost around his \\nneck, and then like a quiver, her body received the savage \\narrows of his lightning-like thrusts; innumerable, torturing; \\narching her pelvis higher and higher until for the first time in \\nher life she reached a shattering climax, felt his hardness break \\nsmd then the crawly flood of semen over her thighs. Slowly \\nher legs relaxed from around his body, slid down until they \\nreach^ the floor. They leaned against each other, out of \\nbreath. \\n\\nIt might have been going on for ;8ome time, but now they \\ncould hear the soft knocking on the door. Sonny quickly \\nbuttoned his trousers, meanwhile blocking the door so that it \\ncould not be opened. Lucy frantically smoothed down her \\npink gown, her eyes flickering, but the thing that had given \\nher so much pleasure was hidden inside sober black cloth. \\nThen they heard Tom Hagen’s voice, very low, ‘Sonny, you \\nin there?’ \\n\\nSonhy sighed with relief. He winked at Lucy. ‘Yeah, Tom, \\nwhat is it?’ \\n\\nHagen’s voice, still low, said, ‘The Don wants you in his \\noflice. Now.’ They could hear his footsteps as he walked away. \\nSonny waited for a few moments, gave Lucy a hard kiss on t^ \\nlips, and then slipped out the door after Hagen. \\n\\nLucy combed her hair. She checked her dress and pulled \\naround her garter straps. Her body felt bruised, her lips pulpy \\nand tender. She went out the door; and though she felt the \\n\\na6 \\n\\n\\n\\nsticky wetness between het thighs she did not go to the bath- \\nroom to wash but ran straight on down the steps and into the \\ngarden. She took her seat at the bridal table next to Q>nnie, \\nwho exclaimed petulantly, ‘Lucy, where were you? You look \\ndrunk. Stay beside me now.* \\n\\nThe blond groom poured Lucy a glass of wine and smiled \\nknowingly. Lucy didn’t care. She lifted the gtapey, dark red \\njuice to her pa^ed mouth and drank. She fdt the sticky \\nwetness between her thighs and pressed her legs together. \\nHer body was trembling. Over the glass rim, as she drank, her \\neyes searched hungrily to find Sonny Corleone. There was no \\none else she cared to see. Slyly she whispered in Connie’s \\near, ‘Only a few hours more and you’ll Imow what it’s all \\nabout.’ Connie giggled. Lucy demurely folded her hands on \\nthe table, treacherously triumphant, as if she had stolen a \\ntreasure from the bride. \\n\\nAmerigo Bonasera followed Hagen into the comer room.of \\nthe house and found Don Corleone sitting behind a huge desk. \\nSonny Corleone was standing by the window, lool^g out \\ninto the garden. For the first time that afternoon the Don \\nbehaved coolly. He did not embrace the visitor or shake \\nhands. The sallow-faced undertaker owed his invitation to the \\nfact that his wife and the wife of the Don were the closest of \\nfriends. Amerigo Bonasera himself was in severe disfavour \\nwith Don Corleone. \\n\\nBonasera began his request obliquely and cleverly. ‘You \\nmust excuse my daughter, your wife’s goddaughter, for not \\ndoing your family the respect of coming today. She is in the \\nhospital still.’ He glanced at Sonny Corleone^ and Tom \\nHagen to indicate that he did not wish to speak brforc them. \\nBut the Don was merciless. \\n\\n‘We all know of your daughter’s misfortune,’ Don Corleone \\nsaid. ‘If I can help her in any way, you have only to speak. My \\nwife is her godmother after all. 1 have never forgotten that \\nhonour.’ This was a rebuke. The undertaker never called Don \\nCorleone ‘Godfather’ as custom dictated. \\n\\nBonasera, ashen-fitced, asked, directly now, ‘May I speak to \\nyou alone?’ \\n\\n\\n*7 \\n\\n\\n\\nDon Corleone shook his head, *1 trust these two men with \\nmy life. They are my two tight arms. 1 cannot insult them by \\nsending them away.’ \\n\\nThe undertaker closed his eyes for a moment and then \\nbegan to speak. His voice was quiet, the voice he used to con- \\nsole the bereaved. raised my daughter in the American \\nfashion. I believe in America. America has made my fortune. \\nI gave my daughter her freedom and yet taught her never to \\ndishonour her family. She found a “boyfriend”, not an \\nItalian. She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. \\nBut he never came to meet her parents. I accepted all this \\nwithout a protest, the fault is mine. Two months ago he took \\nher for a drive. He had a masculine friend with him. They \\nmade her drink whisky and then they tried to take advantage \\nof her. She resisted. She kept her honour. They beat her. Like \\nan animal. When I went to the hospital she had two black \\neyes. Her nose was broken. Her jaw was shattered. They had \\nto wire it together. She wept through her pain. “Father, \\nFather, why did they do it? Why did they do this to me?” \\nAnd I wept.’ Bonasera could not speak further, he was weep- \\ning now though his voice had not betrayed his emotion. \\n\\nDen Corleone, as if against his will, made a gesture of \\nsympathy and Bonasera went on, his voice human with \\nsuffering. ‘Why did I weep? She was the light of my life, an \\naffectionate daughter. A beautiful girl. She tmsted people and \\nnow she will never trust them again. She will never be \\nbeautiful again.’ He was trembling, his sallow face flushed an \\nugly dark red. \\n\\n‘I went to the police like a good American. The two boys \\nwere arrested. They were brought to trial. The evidence was \\noverwhelming and they pleaded guilty. The judge sentenced \\nthem to three years in prison and suspended the sentence. \\nThey went free that very day. I stood in the courtroom like a \\nfool and those bastards smiled at me. And then 1 said to my \\nwife: “We must go to Don Corleone for justice.’” \\n\\nTlie Don had bowed his head to show respect for the man’s \\ngrief. But when he spdke, the words were cold with offended \\n^gnity. ‘Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come \\nto me at the beginning of this a£^?’ \\n\\n2S \\n\\n\\n\\nBonasera muttered almost inaudibly, * What do you want of \\nme? Tell me what you wish. But do what I beg you to do.* \\nThere was something almost insolent in his words, \\n\\nDon Corleonc said gravely, ‘And what is that?’ \\n\\nBonasera glanced at Hagen and Sonny Corlcone and shook \\nhis head. The Don, still sitting at Hagen’s desk, inclined his \\nbody towards the undertaker. Bonasera hesitated, then bent \\ndown and put his lips so close to the Don’s hairy ear that they \\ntouched. Don Corlcone listened like a priest in the confes- \\nsional, gazing away into the distance, impassive, remote. \\nThey stood so for a long moment until Bonasera finished \\nwhispering and straightened to his full height. The Don \\nlooked up gravely at Bonasera. Bonasera, his face Hushed, \\nreturned the stare unflinchingly. \\n\\nFinally the Don spoke. ‘That I cannot do. You are being \\ncarried away.’ \\n\\nBonasera said loudly, clearly, ‘I will pay you anything you \\nask.* On hearing this, Hagen Hinched, a nervous flick of his \\nhead. Sonny Corlcone folded his arms, smiled sardonically as \\nhe turned from the window to watch the scene in the room for \\nthe first time. \\n\\nDon Corleone rose from behind the desk. His face was still \\nimpassive, but his voice rang like cold death. ‘ We have known \\neach other many years, you and I,’ he said to the undertaker, \\n‘but until this day you never came to me for coimsel or help. I \\ncan’t remember the last time you invited me to your house for \\ncoffee, though my wife is godmother to your only child. Let \\nus be frank. You spurned my friendship. You feared to be in \\nmy debt.’ \\n\\nBonasera murmured, ‘Ldidn’t want to get into trouble.* \\n\\nThe Don held up his hand. ‘No. Don’t speak. You found \\nAmerica a paradise. You had a good trade, you made a good \\nliving, you thought the world a harmless place where you \\ncould take your pleasure as you willed. You never armed \\nyourself with true friends. After all, the police guarded you, \\nthere were courts of law, you and yours could come to no \\nharm. You did not need Don Corleone. Very well. My feelings \\nwere wounded, but I am not that sort of person who thrusts \\nhis friendship on those who do not value it - on those who \\n\\n\\n*9 \\n\\n\\n\\nthinlr me of little account/ The Don paused and gave the \\nundertaker a polite, ironic smile. *Now you come to me and \\nsay, *^Don Corleone give me justice/* And you do not ask \\nwidi respect. You do not offer me your friendship. You come \\ninto my home on the bridal day of my daughter and you ask \\nme to do murder and you say’ * here the Don’s voice became \\na scornful mimicry - will pay you anything/’ No, no, I \\nam not offended, but what have I ever done to make you treat \\nme so disrespectfully?’ \\n\\nBonasera eded out in his anguish and his fear, \\'America has \\nbeen good to me. I wanted to be a good citizen. I wanted my \\nchild to be American.* \\n\\nThe Don clapped his hands together with decisive approval. \\n\\'Well spoken. Very fine. Then you have nothing to complain \\nabout. The judge has ruled. America has ruled. Bring your \\ndaughter flowers and a box of candy when you go visit her in \\nthe hospital. That will comfort her. Be content. After all, this \\nis not a serious aflair, the boys were young, high-spirited, and \\none of them is the son of a powerful politician. No, my dear \\nAmerigo, you have slwzys b^ honest. 1 must admit, though \\n^ou spurned my friendship, that I would trust the given word \\nof Amerigo Bonasera more than 1 would any other man’s. \\nSo give me your word that you will put aside this madness. \\nIt is not American. Forgive. Forget, life is full of mis- \\nfortunes.’ \\n\\nThe cruel and contemptuous irony with which all this was \\nsaid, the controlled anger of the Don, reduced the poor under- \\ntaker to a quiveiing jelly, but he spoke up bravdy again. \\'I \\nask you for justice.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone said curtly, \\'The court gave you justice.* \\n\\nBonasera \\'Shook his head stubbornly. \\'No. They gave the \\nyouths justice. They did not give me justice.* \\n\\nThe Don acknowledged this fine dbtinedon with an \\napproving nod, jdien ask^, \\'What is your justice?’ \\n\\n\\'An eye for an eye,\\' Bonasera said. \\n\\n\\'You asked for more,* the Don said. \\'Your daughter is \\nalive.’ \\n\\nBonasera said reluctantly, \\'Let diem sufler as she suffers.* \\nThe Don waited for him to speak farther. Bonasera screwed \\n\\n\\n\\nup the last of his coufage and said, ^How much shall 1 pay \\nyou?’ It was a despairing wail. \\n\\nDon Corleone turned his back. It was a dismissal. Bonasera \\ndid not budge. \\n\\nFinally, sighing, a good-hearted man who cannot remain \\nangry with an erring friend, Don Corleone turned back to the \\nundertaker, who was now as pale as one of his corpses. Don \\nCorleone was gentle, patient. ‘Why do you feat to give your \\nfirst allegiance to me?’ he said. ‘You go to the law courts and \\nwait for months. You spend money on lawyers who know full \\nwell you are to be made a fool of. You accept judgement from \\na judge whO\\' sells himself like the worst whore in the streets. \\nYears gone by, when you needed money, you went to the \\nbanks and paid ruinous interest, waited hat in hand like a \\nbeggar while they sniffed aroimd, poked their noses up your \\nvery asshole to make sure you could pay them back.* The Don \\npaused, his voice became sterner. \\n\\n‘But if you had come to me, my purse would have bec^ \\nyours. If you had come to me for justice those scum who \\nruined your daughter would be weeping bitter tears this day. \\nIf by some misfortune an honest man like yourself made \\nenemies they would become my enemies ’ - the Don raised his \\narm, finger pointing at Bonasera - ‘and then, believe me, they \\nwould fear you.’ \\n\\nBonasera bowed his head and murmured in a strangled \\nvoice, ‘Be my friend. I accept.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone put his hand on the man’s shoulder. ‘Good,’ \\nhe said, ‘you shall have your justice. Some day, and that day \\nmay never come, 1 will call upon you to do me a service in \\nreturn. Until that day, consider this justice a gift from my wife, \\nyour daughter’s godmother.’ \\n\\nWhen the door closed behind the grateful undertaker Don \\nCorleone turned to Hagen and said, ‘Give this affair to \\nQemenza and tell him to be sure to use reliable people, people \\nwho will not be carried away by the smell of blood. After all, \\nwe’re not murderers, no matter what that corpse valet dreams \\nup in his foolish head.* He noted that his first-bom, masculine \\nson was gaaing through the window at the garden party. It \\nwas bopdess, Don Corleone thought. If he refused to be \\n\\n\\n\\ninstructed, Santino could never run the family business, could \\nnever become \\'a Don. He would have to find somebody else. \\nAnd soon. After all, he was not immortal. \\n\\nFrom the garden, startling all three men, there came a happy \\nroaring shout. Sonny Corleone pressed dose to the window. \\nWhat he saw made him move quickly towards the door, a \\ndelighted smile on his face. *It’s Johnny, he came to the \\nwedding, what did I tell you?* Hagen moved to the window, \\n‘It’s really your godson,’ he said to Don CorlTOne. ‘Shall I \\nbring him here?’ \\n\\n‘No,’ the Don said. ‘Let the people enjoy him. Let him \\ncome to me when he is ready.’ He smiled at Hagen. ‘You sec? \\nHe is a good godson.’ \\n\\nHagen felt a twinge of jealousy. He said dryly, ‘It’s been \\ntwoyears. He’s probablyin trouble again and wants you to help.* \\n\\n‘And who should he come to if not his godfadier?’ asked \\nDon Cotleone. \\n\\nThe first one to see Johnny Fontaoe enter the garden was \\nConnie Corleune. She forgot her bridal dignity and screamed, \\n‘Johnece’. Then she ran into his arms. He hugged her tight \\nand kissed her on the mouth, kept his arm around her as \\nothers came up to greet him. They were all ^s old friends, \\npeople he had grown up with on the West Side. Then Connie \\nwas dragging him to her new husband. Johnny saw with \\namusement that the blond young man looked a little sour at no \\nlonger being the star of the day. He turned on all his charm, \\nshaking the groom’s hand, toasting him with a glass of wine. \\n\\nA familiar voice called from the bandstand, ‘How about \\ngiving us a song, Johnny?’ He looked up and saw Nino \\nValenti smiling down at him. Johnny Fontane jumped up on \\nthe bandstand and threw his arms around Nino. They had \\nbeen inseparable, singing together, going out with girls \\ntogether, until Johnny had started to become famous and \\nsing on the radio. When he had gone to Hollywood to make \\nmovies Johnny had phoned Nino a couple of times just to talk \\nand had promised to get him a club singing date. But he had \\nnever done so. Seeing Nino now, his cheerful, mocking, \\ndrunken grin, all the a&ction retumed. \\n\\n\\n5 * \\n\\n\\n\\nKino began stnunming on the mandolin. Johnny Fontane \\nput his hand on Nino’s shoulder. ^This is for the btidc»’ he \\nsaid, and stamping his foot, chanted the words to an obscene \\nSicilian love song. As he sang, Nino made suggestive motions \\nwith his body. The bride blushed proudly, the throng of \\nguests roared its approval. Before the song ended they were \\nali stamping with their feet and roaring out the sly, double- \\nmeaning tag line that finished each stamca. At the end they \\nwould not stop applauding until Johnny cleared his throat to \\nsing another song. \\n\\nThey were all proud of him. He was of them and he had \\nbecome a famous singer, a movie star who slept with the most \\ndesired women in the world. And yet he had shown proper \\nrespect for his Godfather by travelling three thousand ci^es to \\nattend diis wedding. He still loved old friends like Nino \\nValenti. Many of the people there had seen Johrmy and Nino \\nsinging together when they were just boys, when no one \\ndreamed that Johnny Fontane would grow up to hold the \\nhearts of fifty million women in his hands. \\n\\nJohnny Fontane reached down and lifted the bride up on to \\nthe bandstand so that Connie stood between him and Nino. \\nBoth men crouched down, facing each other, Nino plucking \\nthe mandolin for a few harsh chords. It was an old routine of \\ntheirs, a mock battle and wooing, using their voices like \\nswords, each shouting a chorus in turn. With the most delicate \\ncourtesy. Johnny let Nino’s voice overwhelm his own, let \\nNino take the bride from his arm, let Nino swing into the last \\nvictorious stanza while his own voice died away. The whole \\nwedding party hrokeioto shouts of applause,the three of them em- \\nbraced each other at the end. The guests begged for another song. \\n\\nOnly Don Corleone, standing in the corner entrance of the \\nhouse, sensed something amiss. Cheerily, with bluff good \\nhumour, careful not to give ofience to his guests, he called \\nout, ^My godson has come three thousand miles to do us \\nhonour and no one thinks to wet his throat?’ At once a dozen \\nfull wine glasses were thrust at Johnny Fontane. He took a sip \\nfrom all and rushed to embrace his Godfisther. As he did so he \\nwhispered something into the older man’s ear. Don Corleone \\nled hto into the house. \\n\\n\\n\\nTom Hagca hdd out his band when Johnny came into the \\nroom. Johnny shook it and said, *How ate you, Tom?* But \\nwithout his usual charm that consisted of a genuine warmth \\nfor people. Hagen was a litde hurt by this coolness, but \\nshrugged it off. It was one of the penalties for being the Don’s \\nhatchet man. \\n\\nJohnny Fontane said to the Don, * When 1 got the wedding \\ninvitation I said to myself, ^\\'My Godfather isn’t mad at me \\nany more.” I called you five times after my divorce and Tom \\nalways told me you were out or busy, so I knew you were \\nsore.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone was filling glasses from the yellow bottle of \\nStrega. ^That’a all forgotten. Now. Can I do something for \\nyou still? You’re not too fismous, too rich, that 1 can’t help \\nyou?’ \\n\\nJohnny gulped down the yellow fiery liquid and held out his \\nglass to be refilled. He tried to sound jaunty. *I’m not rich. \\nGodfather. I’m going down. You were right. I should never \\nhave left my wife and kids for that tramp 1 married. 1 don’t \\nblame you for gctdng sore at me.’ \\n\\nThe Don shrugged. \\'1 worded about you, you’re my \\ngodson, that’s all.’ \\n\\nJohnny paced up and down the room. was crazy about \\nthat bitch. The biggest star in HoUywood. She looks like an \\nangel. And you know what she does after a picture? If the \\nmake-up man does a good job on her face she lets him bang \\nher. If the cameraman made her look extra good she brings \\nhim into her dressing room and gives him a screw. Anybody. \\nShe uses her body like 1 use the loose change m my pocket for \\na dp. A whore made for the devil.’ \\n\\nDon\\' Corleone curtly broke in. *How is your family?’ \\n\\nJohnny sighed. took care of them. After the divorce 1 \\ngave Ginny and the kids more than the courts said I should. 1 \\ngo see them once a week. 1 miss them. Sometimes I think I’m \\ngoing crazy.’ He took another drink. !Now my second wife \\nlaughs at me. She can’t understand my being jealous. She calls \\nme an old-fashioned guinea, she makes fi^ of my singing. \\nBefore 1 left I gave ^ a beating, but not in the fiioe \\nbecause she was making a picture. I gave her ciamps, 1 \\n\\n\\n54 \\n\\n\\n\\npunched her on the arms and legs like a kid and she kept \\nlaughing at me.* He lit a cigarette. * So, Godfather, right now, \\nlife doe8n*t seem worth living.* \\n\\nDon Corleone said simply, ^These are troubles 1 can’t help \\nyou with.* He paused, then asked, ’What’s the matter ^trith \\nyour voice?* \\n\\nAll the assured charm, the self-mockery, disappeared from \\nJohnny Fontane’s face. He said almost brokenly, ’God&ther, \\nI can’t sing any more, something happened to my throat, the^ \\ndoctors don’t know what.* Hagen and the Don leaked at him \\nwith surprise, Johnny had always been so tough. Fontane went \\non. ’My two pictures made a lot of money. I was a big star. \\nNow they throw me out. The head of the studio always hated \\nmy guts, and now he’s paying mt off.* \\n\\nDon Corleone s^pod b^re his godson and asked grimly, \\n’Why doesn’t this man like you?’ \\n\\n’I used to sing those songs for the liberal organkadons, you \\nknow, all that stuff you never liked me to do. Well, jiudk \\nWaltz didn’t like it either. He called me a Communist, but he \\ncouldn’t make it sddr. Then I snatched a gkl he had saved for \\nhimself. It was stdedy a one-night stand and she came after \\nme. What the hell could 1 do? Then my whore second wife \\nthrows me out. And Ginny and the kids won’t take me back \\nunless 1 come ctawUng on my hands and knees, and I can’t \\nsing any mote. God&ther, what the hell can 1 do?’ \\n\\nDon Gorleone’s fece had become cold without a hint of \\nsympathy. He said contemptuously, ’You can start by acting \\nlike a man.’ Suddenly anger contorted his fece. He shouted. \\n’LtKB A manI’ He reached over the desk and grabbed Johnny \\nFontane by the hair of his head in a gesture that was savagely \\naffectionate. ’By Christ in heaven, is it possible that you spent \\nso much time in presence and tuti^ out no better than \\nthis? A Holl 3 rwood finoetUo who weeps and begs for pity? \\nWho cries out like a woman - ”Wbat shall I do? Oh, what \\nshall I do?”’ \\n\\nThe mimkxy of the Don was so extraordinary, so unex- \\npected, diat Hagen and Johnny were startled into laughter. \\nDon Corleone was plea^. For a moment he reflected on \\nhow mudi he loved this godson. How would his own three \\n\\n\\n\\nsons have reacted to such a tongue-lashing? Sandno would \\nhave sulked and behaved badly for weeks afterwards. Fredo \\nwould have been cowed. Michael would have given him a cold \\nsmile and gone out of the house, not to be seen for months. \\nBut Johnny, ah, what a £ne chap he was, stniHng now, \\ngathering strength, knowing already the true purpose of his \\nGodfather. \\n\\nDon Corleone went on. ‘You took the woman of your boss, \\na man more powerful than yourself, then you complain he \\nwon’t help you. What nonsense. You left your family, your \\nchildren without a fatlicr, to marry a whore and you weep \\nbecause they don’t welcome you back with open arms. The \\nwhore, you don’t hit her in the face because she is making a \\npicture, then you are ainaaed because she laughs at you. You \\nlived Like a fool and you have come to a fool’s end.* \\n\\nDon Corleone paused to ask in a patient voice, ‘Are you \\nwilling to take my advice this time?’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontane shrugged. ‘I can’t marry Ginny again, not \\nthe way she wants. I have to gamble, 1 have to drink, I have to \\ngo out with the boys. Beautiful broads run after me and 1 \\nnever could resist them. Then I used to feel like a heel when I \\nwent back to Ginny. Christ, 1 can’t go through all that crap \\nagain.’ \\n\\nIt was rare that Don Corleone showed exasperation. ‘I \\ndidn’t tell you to get married again. Do what you want. It’s \\ngood you wish to be a ftther to your children. A man who is \\nnot a fttlicr to his children can never be a real man. But then, \\nyou must make their mother accept you. Who says you can’t \\nsee them every day? Who says you can’t live in the same \\nhouse? Who says you can’t live your life exactly as you want to \\nlive it?* \\n\\nJohnny Fontane laughed. ‘Godfather, not all women arc \\nlike the old Italian wives. Ginny won’t stand for it.’ \\n\\nNow the Don was mocking. ‘Because you acted like a \\nfifwcMe, You gave her more than the court said. You didn’t hit \\nthe other in the fice because she was making a picture. You \\nlet women dictate your actions and they are not competent in \\nthis world, though certainly they will be saints in heaven while \\nwe men bum in hell. And then I’ve watched you all these \\n\\n\\n\\nyears.’ The Don’s voice bec^e earnest. * You’ve been a fine \\ngodson, you’ve given me all the respect. But what of your \\nother old friends? One year you run around with this person, \\nthe next year with another person. That Italian boy who was so \\nfunny in the movies, he had some bad luck and you never saw \\nhim again because you were more famous. And how about \\nyour old, old comrade that you went to sdiool with, who was \\nyour partner singing? Nino. He drinks too much out of dis- \\nappointment, but he never complains. He works hard driving \\nthe gravel truck and sings weekends for a few JoUars. He \\nnever says anything against you. You couldn’t help him a bit? \\nWhy not? He sings well.’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontane said with patient weariness, ‘Godfather, he \\njust hasn’t got enough talent. He’s OK, but he’s not big \\ntime.’ \\n\\nDon Corlepne lidded his eyes almost closed and then said, \\n‘And you, godson, you now, you just don’t have talent \\nenough. ShaitI get you a job on the gravel truck with Nino?’ \\nWhen Johnny didn’t answer, the Don went on. ‘Friendship is \\neverything. Friendship is more than talent. It is mote than \\ngovernment. It is almost the equal of family. Never forget \\nthat. If you had built up a wall of friendships you wouldn’t \\nhave to ask me to help. Now tell me, why can’t you sing? You \\nsang well in the garden. As well as Nino.’ \\n\\nHagen and Johnny smiled at this delicate thrust. It was \\nJohnny’s turn to be patronizingiy patient. ‘My voice is weak. \\nI sing one or two songs and then I can’t sing again for hours or \\ndays. I can’t make it ^ough the rehearsals or the retakes. My \\nvoice is weak, it’s got some sort of sickdess.’ \\n\\n‘So you have woman trouble. Your voice is sick. Now tell \\nme the trouble you’re having with this HoMj^ood \\nwho won’t let you work.’ The Don was getting down to \\nbusiness. \\n\\n‘He’s bigger than one of yom pei(;(pnopa 9 ti* Johnny said. \\n‘He owns tibe studio. He advises the President on movie \\npropaganda for the war. Just a month ago he bought the \\nmovie rights to the biggest novel of the year. A bestseller. \\nAnd the main character is a guy just like me. 1 wouldn’t even \\nhave to act, just be myself. 1 w^dn’t even have to sing. 1 \\n\\n\\n57 \\n\\n\\n\\nmight even win the Academy Award. Everybody knows\\' it\\'s \\np^ect for me and I^d be big again. As an actor. But that \\nbastard Jack Wolta is paying me off, he won^t give it to me. 1 \\nofiered to do it for nothing, for a minimi iin ptice onH be \\nsays no. He sent the word t^t if I come and kiss his ass in the \\nstudio commissary, maybe he’ll think about it.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone dismissed this emotional nonsense with a \\nwave of his hand. Among reasonable men problems of \\nbusiness could always be solved. He patted his godson on the \\nshoulder. * You’re discouraged. Nobody cares about you, so \\nyou think. And you’ve lost a lot of weight. You drink a lot, \\neh? You don’t sleep and you take pills?’ He shook his head \\ndisapprovingly. \\n\\n‘ Now I want you to follow my orders,’- the Don said. *I want \\nyou to stay in my house for one month. I want you to eat well, \\nto^rest and sleep. I want you to be my companion, I enjoy \\nyour company, and maybe you can learn something about the \\nworld from your Godfather that might even help you in the \\ngreat Hollywood. But no singing, no drinking, and no \\nwomen. At the end of the month you can go back to Holly- \\nwood and this calibre will give you that \\n\\njob you want. Done?’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontane could not altogether believe that the Don \\nhad such power. But his Godfather had never said such and \\nsuch a thing could be done without having it done. ’This guy \\nis a persond friend of J. Edgar Hoover,’ Johnny said. ^You \\ncan’t even raise your voice to him.’ \\n\\n‘He’s a businessman,’ the Don said blandly. ‘I’ll make him \\nan offer he can’t refuse.’ \\n\\n‘It’s too late,’ Johnny said. ‘All the contracts have been \\nsigned^ and they start shooting in a week. It’s absolutely im- \\npossible.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone said, ‘Go, go back to the party. Your friends \\nare waiting for you. Leave everything to me.’ He pushed \\nJohnny Fontane out of the room. \\n\\nHagen sat behind the desk and made notes. The Don heaved \\na sigh and asked, ‘Is there anything else?’ \\n\\n‘Sollozzo can’t be put off any mote. You’U have to see him \\nthis week.’ Hagen held his pen over die calendar. \\n\\n58 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Don shragged. *Now that the wedding k over* when- \\never you like.’ \\n\\nThis answer told Hagen two things. Most important, that \\nthe answer to Virgil Sollozao would be no. The second, that \\nDon Corleone, since he would not give the answer before his \\ndaughter’s wedding, expected his no to cause trouble. \\n\\nHagen said cautiously, * Shall 1 tell Qemen^a to have some \\nmen come live in the house?’ \\n\\nThe Don said impatiently, ^For what? 1 didn’t answer \\nbefore the wedding because on an important day like that \\nthere should be no cloud, not even in the distance. Also 1 \\nwanted to know beforehand what he wanted to talk about. \\nWe know now. What he will propose is an infamita* \\n\\nHagen asked, ‘Then you will refuse?’ When the Don \\nnodded, Hagen said, ‘I think we should all discuss it - die \\nwhole Family - before you give your answer.’ \\n\\nThe Don smiled. ‘You think so? Good, we will discuss it. \\nWhen you come back from Gdifomia. 1 want you to fly diere \\ntomorrow and settle this business for Johnny. See that movie \\nTell S 0 II 0220 1 will see him when you get badt \\nfrom California. Is there anything else?’ \\n\\nHagen said formally, ‘The hospital called. \\nAbbandando is dying, he won’t last out the night. His fiunily \\nwas told to come and wait.’ \\n\\nHagen had filled the ConstgliotrV% post for the past year, ever \\nsince the cancer had imprisoned Genco Abbandando in his \\nhospital bed. Now be waited to hear Don Corleone say the \\npost was his permanently. The odds were against it. So high a \\nposition was traditionally given only to a man descended from \\ntwo Italian parents. There had alre^y been trouble about his \\ntemporary performance of the duties. Also, lie was cmly \\nthirty-five, not old enough, ^pposedly, to have acquired the \\nnecessary experience and cunning for a successful Oms^fiori. \\n\\nBut the Don gave him no encouragement. He asked, ‘When \\ndoes my daughter leave with her bridegroom?’ \\n\\nHagen looked at his wristwatch. ‘In a few minutes tiieyHl \\ncut ^ cake and then a harbour after that.’ That reminded \\nhim of something else. ‘Your new son-in-law. Do we give \\nhim something important, inside die Family?’ \\n\\n\\n\\nHe was surprised at the vehemence of the Don^s answer. \\n‘Never.* The Don hit the desk with the flat of his hand. \\n‘Never. Give him something to earn his living, a good \\nliving. But never let him know the Family’s business. Tdl the \\nothers. Sonny, Frcdo, Qemen:sa.’ \\n\\nThe Don paused. * Instruct my sons, all three of them, that \\nthey will accompany me to the hospit^ to see poor Genco. I \\nwant them to pay their last respects. Tell Freddie to drive the \\nbig car and ask Johnny if he will come with us, as a special \\nfavour to me.’ He saw Hagen look at him questioningly. ‘I \\nwant you to go to Califomia tonight. You won’t have time to \\ngo see Genco. But don’t leave until I come back from the \\nhospital and speak with you. Under\\'s tood ? * \\n\\n‘ Understood,’ Hagen said. * What time should Fred have the \\ncar waiting?’ \\n\\n* When the guests have left/ Don Corleone said. ‘Genco will \\nwait for me.’ \\n\\n‘The Senator called,’ Hagen said. ‘Apologizing for not \\ncoming personally but that you would understand. He \\nprobably means these two FBI men across the street taking \\ndown licence numbers. But he sent his gift over by special \\nmessenger.’ \\n\\nThe Don nodded. He did not think it necessary to mention \\nthat he himself had warned the Senator not to come. ‘Did he \\nsend a nice present?’ \\n\\nHagen made a face of impressed approval that was very \\nstrangely Italian on his German-Irish features. ‘Antique \\nsilver, very valuable. The kids can sell it for a grand at least. \\nThe Senator spent a lot of time getting exactly the right thing. \\nFor those kind of people that’s more important than how \\nmuch it costs.’ \\n\\nDon Corleohe did not hide his pleasure that so great a man \\nas the Senator had shown him such respect. The Senator, like \\nLuca Brasi, was one of the great stones in the Don\\'s power \\nstructure, and he too, with this gift, had reswom his \\nloyalty. \\n\\nWhen Johnny Fontane appeared in the garden Kay Adams \\nrecognized him immediately. She was truly surprise. ‘You \\n\\n\\n40 \\n\\n\\n\\nnever told me your fimiily knew Johnny Fontane,’ she said. \\n‘Now I’m sure I’ll marry you.’ \\n\\n‘Do you want to meet him?* Michael asked. \\n\\n‘Not now/ Kay said. She sighed. ‘I was in love with him \\nfor three years. I used lo come down to New York whenever \\nhe sang at the Capitol and scream my head o£F. He was so \\nwonderful.* \\n\\n‘We’ll meet him later/ Michael said. \\n\\nWhen Johnny finished singing and vanished into the house \\nwith Don Corlcone, Kay said archly to Michael, ‘Don’t tell \\nme a big movie star like Johnny Fontane has to ask your \\nfather for a favour?’ \\n\\n‘He’s my father’s godson/ Michael said. ‘And if it wasn’t \\nfor my father he might not be a big movie star today.’ \\n\\nKay Adams laughed with delight. ‘That sounds like another \\ngreat story.’ \\n\\nMichael shook his head. ‘I can’t teU that one/ he said. \\n\\n‘Trust me,’ she said. \\n\\nHe told her. He told her without being funny. He told it \\nwithout pride. He told it without any sort of explanation \\nexcept that eight years before his father had been more \\nimpetuous, and because the matter concerned his godson, \\nthe Don considered it an afiair of personal honour. \\n\\nThe story was quickly told. Eight years ago Johnny Fontane \\nhad made an extraordinary success singing with a popular \\ndance band. He had become a top radio attraction. Unfor- \\ntunately the band leader, a well-known show business per- \\nsonality named Les Halley, had signed Johnny to a five-year \\npersoi^ services contract. It was a common show-business \\npractice. Les Halley could now loan Johnny out and pocket \\nmost of the money. \\n\\nDon Codeone entered the negotiations personally. He \\nofiered Les Halley twenty thousand dollars to release Johnny \\nFontane horn the personal services contract. Halley o^ered to \\ntake only fifty per cent of Johnny’s earnings. Don Corlcone \\nwas amused. He dropped his offer from twenty thousand \\ndoUars to ten thousand dollars. The band leader, obviously \\nnot a man of the world outside his beloved show business, com- \\ntdetely missed the -significance of this lower ofier. He rdfused. \\n\\n\\n41 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day Don Cotleone went to see the band leader \\npersonally. He brought with him his two best friends, \\nGenco Abbandando, who was his Consigliori^ and Luca Brasi. \\nWith no other witnesses Don Corleone persuaded Les Halley \\nto sign a document giving up all rights to all services from \\nJohnny Fontane upon payment of a certified cheque to the \\namount of ten thousand dollars. Don Corleone did this by \\nputting a pistol to the forehead of the band leader and assuring \\nhim with the utmost seriousness that either his signature or his \\nbrains would rest on that document in exactly one minute. \\nLes Halley signed. Don Corleone pocketed his pistol and \\nhanded over the certified cheque. \\n\\nThe rest was history. Johnny Fontane went on to become \\nthe greatest singing sensation in the country. He made Holly- \\nwood musicals that earned a fortune for his studio. His \\nrecords made millions of dollars. Then he divorced his child- \\nhood-sweetheart wife and lefr his two children, to marry the \\nmost glamorous blonde star in motion pictures. He soon \\nlearned that she was a ‘whore*. He drank, he gambled, he \\nchased other women. He lost his singing voice. His records \\nstopped selling. The studio did not renew his contract. And \\nso now he had come back to his Godfrther. \\n\\nKay said thoughtfully, ‘Are you sure you’re not jealous of \\nyour father? Everything you’ve told me about him shows him \\ndoing something for other people. He must be good-hearted.’ \\nShe smiled wryly. ‘Of course his methods are not exactly \\nconstitutional.’ \\n\\nMichael sighed. *I guess that’s the way it sounds, but let me \\ntell you this. You Imow those Arctic explorers who leave \\ncaches of food scattered on the route to the North Pole? \\nJust in case they may need diem some day? That’s my \\nfather’s frvours. Some day he’ll be at each one of those \\npeople’s houses and diey had better come across.’ \\n\\nIt was nearly twilight before the wedding cake was shown, \\nexclaimed over, and eaten. Specially baked by Nazorine, it was \\ndeverly decorated with shells of cream so dizzyingly ddidous \\ndiat die bdde greedily plucked them from the corpse of the \\ncake befi^re she whiwied away on her honeymoon with her \\nblond groom. The Don policy sped his* guests’ dqsartore. \\n\\n\\n4 * \\n\\n\\n\\nnodng meanwhile that the black sedan with its FBI men was \\nno longer visible. \\n\\nFinally, the only car left in the driveway was the long black \\nCadillac with Freddie at the wheeL^The Don got into the front \\nseat, moving with quick coordination for his age and bulk. \\nSonny, Michael, and Johnny Fontane got into the back seat. \\nDon Corleone said to his son Michael, ‘Your girlfriend, she’ll \\nget back to the city by herself all right?’ \\n\\nMichael nodded. ‘Tom said he’d take care of it.’ Don \\n(^rleone nodded with satisfaction at Hagen’s efficiency. \\n\\nBecause of the gas rationing still in efiect, there was little \\ntraffic on the Belt Parkway to Manhattan. In less than an hour \\nthe Cadillac rolled into the street of French Hospital. During \\nthe ride Don Corleone asked his youngest son if he was doing \\nwell in school. Michael nodded. Then Sonny in the back scat \\nasked his father, ‘Johnny says you’re getting him squared \\naway with that Hollywood business. Do you want me to go \\nout there and help?’ \\n\\nDon Corleone was curt. ‘Tom is going tonight. He won’t \\nneed any help, it’s a simple aftiir.’ \\n\\nSonny Corleone laughed. ‘Johnny thinks you can’t fix it, \\nthat’s why 1 thought you might want me to go out there.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone turned his head. ‘Why do you doubt me?’ he \\nasked Johnny Fontane. ‘Hasn’t your Godfrther always done \\nwhat he said he would do? Have 1 ever been taken for afool?’ \\n\\nJohnny apologized nervously. ‘Godfather, the man who \\nruns it is a .90 calibre pa^nmf€mt 9 . You can’t budge him, \\n\\nnot even with money. He has big connexions. And he hates \\nme. 1 just don’t know how you can swing it.’ \\n\\nThe Don spoke with affectionate amusement. ‘1 say to you: \\nyou shall have it.’ He nudged Michael with his elbow. ‘We \\nwon’t disappoint my godson, eh, Michael?’ \\n\\nMichael, who never doubted his &ther for a moment, shook \\nhis head. \\n\\nAs they walked towards the hospital entrance, Don Cor- \\nleone put his hand on Michael’s arm so that the o^ers forged \\nahead. ‘When you get through with college, come and talk to \\nme,’ the Don said. ‘1 have some plans you will like.’ \\n\\nMichael didn’t say anything. Don Corleone grunted in \\n\\n\\n45 \\n\\n\\n\\nexasperation. know how you ate. 1 won’t ask you to do \\nanything you don’t approve of. This is something special. Go \\nyour own way now, you’re a man after all. But come to me as a \\nson should when you have finished with your schooling.’ \\n\\nThe family of Gcnco Abbandando, wife and three daughters \\ndressed in black, clustered like a flock of plump crows on the \\nwhite tile floor of tlie hospital corridor. When they saw Don \\nCorleone come out of the elevatoi they seemed to flutter up \\noff the white tiles in an instinctive surge towards him for \\nprotection. The mother was regally stout in black, the \\ndaughters fat and plain. Mrs Abbandando pecked at Don \\nCorleone’s cheek, sobbing, wailing, ‘ Oh, what a saint you arc, \\nto come here on your daughter’s wedding day.* \\n\\nDon Corleone brushed these thanks aside. ‘Don’t I owe \\nrespect to such a friend, a friend who has been my right arm \\nfor twenty years?’ He had understood immediately that the \\nsoon-to-be widow did not comprehend that her husband \\nwould die this night. Genco Abbandando had been in this \\nhospital for nearly a year dying of his cancer and the wife had \\ncome to consider his fatal illness almost an ordinary part of \\nlife. Tonight was just another crisis. She babbled on. ‘Go in \\nand see my poor husband,’ she said, ‘he asks for you. Poor, \\nman, he wanted to come to the wedding to show his respect, \\nbut the doctor would not permit it. Then he said you would \\ncome to see him on this great day, but I did not believe it \\npossible. Ah, men understand friendship more than we \\nwomen. Go inside, you will make him happy.’ \\n\\nA nurse and a doctor came out of Genco Abbandando’s \\nprivate room. The doctor was a young man, serious-faced and \\nwith the air of one born to command, that is to say, the air of \\none who has been immensely rich all his life. One of the \\ndaughters asked timidly, ‘ Dr Kennedy, can we go to see him \\nnow?’ \\n\\nDr Kennedy looked over the large group with exasperation. \\nDidn’t these people rcalixe that the man inside was dying \\nand dying in torturous pain? It would be much better if every- \\none let him die in peace. ‘I think just the immediate family/ \\nhe said in his exquisitely polite voice. He was surprised \\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the wife and daughters turned to the short, heavy man \\ndressed in an awkwardly £tted tuxedo, as if to hear his \\ndecision. * \\n\\nThe heavy man spoke. There was just the slightest trace of \\nan Italian accent in his voice. \"My dear doaor,’ said Don \\nCorleone, \" is it true he is dying? ’ \\n\\n\"Yes/ said Dt Kennedy. \\n\\n\"Then there is nothing more for you to do/ said Don \\nCorleone. \"We will take up the burden. We wiD comfort him. \\nWe will dose his eyes. We will bury him and weep at his \\nfuneral and afterwards we will watch over his wife and \\ndaughters.’ At hearing things put so bluntly, forcing her to \\nunderstand, Mrs Abbandando ^gan to weep. \\n\\nDr Kennedy shrugged. It was impossible to explain to these \\npeasants. At the same time he recognized the crude justice in \\nthe man’s remarks. His role was over. Still exquisitely polite, \\nhe said, \"Please wait for the nurse to let you in, she has a few \\nnecessary things to do with the patient.’ He walked away from \\nthem down the corridor, his white coat flapping. \\n\\nThe nurse went back into the room and they waited. Finally \\nshe came out again, holding the door for them to enter. She \\nwhispered, ‘He’s delirious with the pain and fever, try not to \\nexdte him. And you can stay only a few minutes, except for the \\nwife.’ She recognized Johnny Fontane as he went by her and \\nher eyes opened wide. He gave her a faint smile of acknow- \\nledgement and she stared at him with frank invitation. He fled \\nher away for future reference, then followed the others into \\nthe sick man’s room. \\n\\nGenco Abbandando had run a long race with death, and \\nnow, vanquished, he lay exhausted on the raised bed. He was \\nwasted away to no more than a skdeton, and what had once \\nbeen vigorous black hair had turned into obscene stringy \\nwisps. Don Corleone said cheerily, \"Genco, dear friend, I have \\nbrought my sons to pay their respects, and look, even Johnny \\nall the way from Hollywood.’ \\n\\nThe dying man raised his fevered eyes gratefully to the Don. \\nHe let the young men clasp his bony hand in their fleshy ones. \\nHis wife and daughters ranged themsdves along his bed, \\nkissing his cheek, taking his other hand in turn. \\n\\n\\n45 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Don pressed his old fidend’s hincL He said comfort- \\ningly, *Hurry up and get better and well take a trip to Italy \\ntog^et to our old village. We’ll play bom$ in frcmt of the \\nwineshop like our fiithets before us.’ \\n\\nThe dying man shook his head, fie motioned the young \\nmen and his fiunily away from his bedside; widi the other \\nbony daw he hung fast to the Don. He tri^ to speak. The \\nDon put his head down and then sat on the bedside chair. \\nGenco Abbandando was babbling about their childhood. \\nThen his coal-black eyes became sly. He whispered. The Don \\nbent doser. The others in the room were astonished to see \\ntears running down Don Corleone’s free as he shook his head. \\nThe quavering voice grew louder, filling the room. With a \\ntortured, superhuman effort, Abbandando lifted his head off \\nhis pillow, eyes unseeing, and pointed a skeletal forefinger at \\nthe Don. ^Godfather, Godfather,’ he called out blindly, ’save \\nme from death, 1 beg of you. I^y flesh is burning off my bones \\nand 1 can fed the worms eating away my brain. Godfrther, \\ncure me, you have the power, dry the tears of my poor wife. \\nIn Corleone we played together as children, and now wiU you \\nlet me die when 1 fear hell for my sins?’ \\n\\nThe Don was silent. Abbandando said, ’It is your daughter’s \\nwedding day, you cannot refuse me.’ \\n\\nThe Don spoke quietly, gravdy, to pierce through the \\nblasphemous delirium. ’Old friend,’ he said, ’1 have no such \\npowers. If I did I would be more merciful than God, believe \\nme. But don’t fear death and don’t fear hell. I will have a mass \\nsaid for your soul every night and every morning. Your wife \\nand your children will pray for you. How can God punish you \\nwith so many pleas for mercy?’ \\n\\nThe skeleton face took on a cunning expression that was \\nobscene. Abbandando said slyly, \\'It’s been arranged then?’ \\n\\nWhen the Don answered, his voice was cold, without \\ncomfort. ’You blaspheme. Resign yourself.’ \\n\\nAbbandando fell back on the pillow. His eyes lost their wild \\ngleam of hope. The nurse came back into the room and started \\nshooing them out in a very matter-of-fret way. The Don got \\nup, but Abbandando put out his hand. ’GoeflEsther,’ he said, \\n’stay here with me and help me meet death. Perhaps if He sees \\n\\n46 \\n\\n\\n\\nyou neair me He vnU be filghteiied and leave me in peace. Or \\nperhaps you can say a word, puU a few strings, eh?* The \\ndying man winked as if he were mocking the Don, now not \\nreally serious. ^You’re brothers in blood, after all.’ Iben, as if \\nfeadng the Don would be offended, he clutched at his hand. \\n*Stay with me, let me hold your hand. We’ll outwit that \\nbastard as we’ve outwitted others. Godfether, don’t betray me.* \\n\\nThe Don motioned the other people out of the room. They \\nleft. He took the withered claw of Genco Abbandando in his \\nown two broad hands. Softly, reassuringly, he comforted his \\nfriend, as they waited for deadi together. As if the Don could \\ntruly snatch the life, of Genco Abbandando back from that \\nmost foul and criminal traitor to man. \\n\\nThe wedding day of Connie Corleone ended well for her. \\nCarlo Bjzsd performed his duties as a bridegroom with skill \\nand vigour, spurred on by the contents of the bride’s gift purse \\nwhich totall^ up to over twenty thousand dolbrs. The \\nbride, however, gave up her virginity^ with a great deal more \\nwillingness than she gave up her purse. For the latter, he had \\nto blacken one of her eyes. \\n\\nLucy Mancini waited in her house for a call from Sonny \\nCorleone, sure that he would ask her for a date. Finally she \\ncalled his house and whenshe heard a woman’s voice answer the \\nphoneshehungup. Shehadno way ofknowing that nearly every- \\none at the wedding had remarked the absence of her and Sonny \\nfor that fatal half hour and the gossip was already spreading \\nthat Santino Corleone had found another victim. That he \\nhad Mone the job’ on his own sister’s maid of honour. \\n\\nAmerigo Donasera had a terrible nightmare. In his dreams \\nhe saw Don Corleone, in peaked cap, overalls,’and heavy \\ngloves, unloading bullet-riddled corpses in front of his funeral \\nparlour and shouting, * Remember, Amerigo, not a word to \\nanyone, and bury them quickly.’ He groaned so loudandlong in \\nhis sleep that his wife shook him awake. *Eh, what a man you \\nare,’ she grumbled. * To have a nightmare only after a wedding. ’ \\n\\nKay Adams was escorted to her New York City hotel by \\nPauUe Gatto and Qdnenaa. The car was large, luxurious, and \\ndriven by Gatto. Qemenza sat in the back seat and Kay was \\n\\n\\n47 \\n\\n\\n\\ngived the front seat next to the ddver. She found both men \\nwildly exotic. Their speech ^was movie Brooklynese and they \\ntreated her with exaggerated courtliness. Duri^ the ride she \\nchatted casually with both men and was surprised when they \\nspoke of Michael with unmistakable a£Fection and tespect. He \\nhad led het to believe* that he was an alien in his fafoer*s \\nworld. Now Clemenxa was assuring her in his wheeaing \\nguttural voice that the ‘old man* thought Mike was the best of \\nhis sons, the one who would surely inherit the fiimily business. \\n\\n‘ What business is that ? ’ Kay asked in the most natural way. \\n\\nPaulie Gatto gave hei* a quick glance as he turned the \\nwheel. Behind her Qemenza said in a surprised voice. ‘Dida*t \\nMike tell you? Mr Q>rleone is the biggest importer of Italian \\nolive oil in the States. Now that the war is over the business \\ncould get real rich. He*ll need a smart boy like Mike.’ \\n\\nAt the hotel Clemenxa insisted on coming to the desk with \\nhet. When she protested, he said simply, ‘The boss said to \\nmake sure you got home OK. I gotta do it.* \\n\\nAfter she received her room key he walked her to the \\nelevator and waited until she got in. She waved to him, \\nsmiling, and was surprised at his genuine smile of pleasure in \\nreturn. It was just as well she did not see him go iMck to the \\nhotel clerk and ask, ‘ What name she registered under?* \\n\\nTlic hotel clerk looked at Qemenza coldly. Qemenza rolled \\nthe little green spitball he was holding in his hand across to the \\nclerk, who picked it up and immediately said, ‘Mr and Mrs \\nMichael Corleone.* \\n\\nBack in the car, Paulie Gatto said, ‘Nice dame.* \\n\\nQemenza grunted. ‘ Mike is doing the job on her.’ Unless, \\nhe thought, they were really married. ‘Pick me up early in the \\nmorning,* he told Paulie. G^tto. ‘Hagen got some deal for us \\nthat gotta be done tight away.’ \\n\\nIt was late Sunday night before Tom Hagen could kiss his \\nwife goodbye and drive out to the airport. With his special \\nnumber one priority (a grateful gift ftom a Pentagon staff \\ngeneral ofHcer) he no trouble getting on a plane to Los \\nAngeles. \\n\\nIt had been a busy but satisfying day for Tom Hagen. Genco \\n\\n48 \\n\\n\\n\\nAbbaddAndo had died at three in the morning and when Don \\nCorleonc returned from the hospital, he had informed Hagen \\nthat he wsa now officially the new ConsigHm to the fitmily. \\nThis meant that Hagen was sure to become a very xidi man, to \\nsay nothing of power* \\n\\nThe Don had broken a long-standing ttadition. The \\nConsiglim was always a full-blooded Sicilian, and the fact that \\nHagen had been brought up as a member of the Don’s family \\nmade no difierence to that tradition. It was a question of blood- \\nOnly a Sicilian bom to the ways of omerta^ the law of silence, \\ncould be trusted in the key post of Consigliori. \\n\\nBetween the head of the fiunily, Don G>rleone, who dic- \\ntated policy, and the operating krel of men who actually \\ncarried out ^e orders of the Don, there were three layers, or \\nbufiers. In that way nothing could be traced to the top. Unless \\nthe Consigli&ri turned traitor. That Sunday morning Don \\nCorleone gave explicit instructions on what should be done to \\nthe two young men who hsul beaten the daughter of Amerigo \\nBonasera. But he had given those orders in private to Tom \\nHagen. Later in the day Hagen had, also in private without \\nwitnesses, instructed Oemenaa. In turn Oememai had told \\nPaulie Gatto to execute the commission. Paulie Gatto would \\nnow muster the necessary manpower and execute the orders. \\nPaulie Gatto and his men would not know why this particular \\ntask was being carried out or who had ordered it originally. \\nEach link of the chain would have to turn traitor for the Don \\nto be involved and though it had never yet happened, there \\nwas always the possibility. The cure for that possibility also \\nwas known. Only one link in the chain had to ^sappear. \\n\\nThe Cmmgiiori was also what his name implied. JFie was the \\ncounsellor to the Don, his right-hand man, his aui^iary brain. \\nHe was also hiS closest companion and his closest friend. On \\nimportant trips he would drive the Don’s car, at conferences \\nhe would go out and get the Don refreshments, codec and \\nsandwiches, fresh cigars. He would know everything the Don \\nknew or nearly everything, all the cells of power. He was the \\none man in the world who could bring the Don crashing down \\nto destruction. But no CMsigfim had ever betrayed a Don, not \\nin the memory of any of the powerful Sicilian fisimilies who had \\n\\n\\n49 \\n\\n\\n\\nestibliilied tfaemtelyes in Afnedcm. Tl^ \\n\\nAnd every CmuigUm knew that if he kept the 6ddi, be would \\nbecome licfa, wkdd power, and win reipect. If miifortune \\ncame, his wife and children would be sheltered and cared £6t \\nas if ^ were alhre or free. I/Jk kgpt /fe ftM. \\n\\nIn some matters die Cmsigfhri had to act for his Don in a \\nmore open way and yet not involve his principal. Hagen was \\nflying to Qdifotnia on just such a matter. He realhsed that his \\ncareer as Cmmglkri woidd be seriously affxted by the success \\nor feihire of this mission. By femily business standards whether \\nJohnny Fontane got his coveted part in the war movie^ or did \\nno^ was a minor matter. Far more important was the meeting \\nHagen had set- up with Virgil SoUosbeo the following Friday. \\nBut Hagen knew that to the Don, both were of equal impor- \\ntance, which setded the matter for any good Consig^ori. \\n\\nThe piston plane shook Tom Hagen’s already nervous in- \\nsides and he ordered a martini from the hostess to quiet them. \\nBoth the Don and Johnny had briefed him on die character of \\nthe movie producer. Jack Wdka. From everything that Johnny \\nsaid, Hagen knew he would never be able to persuade Wolta. \\nBut he also had no doubt whatsoever that the Don would keep \\nhis promise to Johnny; His own role was that of negotiator \\nand contact. \\n\\nLying back in his seat, Hagen went over all the information \\ngiven to him that day. Jack Woita was one of the three most \\nimportant movie producecs in Hollywood, owner of his own \\nstudio with doaens of stars under conttact. He wis on the \\nPresident of the United States* Advisory Council for War \\nInformation, Cinematic Division, which meant simply that he \\nhelped make propaganda movie^ He had had dinner at the \\nWhite flouse. He had entertained J. Edgar Hoover in his \\nHollywood home. But none of this was as impressive as it \\nsounded. They were all oflSdal relationships. Woltz didn’thave \\nany personal political power, mainly because he was an \\nextreme reactionary, pa^y because he was a m^alomaniac \\nwho loved to wield power wildly without regard to the feet \\nthat by so doing legions of enmics sprang up out of the \\nground. \\n\\nHagen sighed. There would be no way to * handle’ Jadt \\n\\nJO \\n\\n\\n\\nWolt2. He opened his briefcase and tried to get some paper \\nwork done, but he was too tired. He ordered another martini \\nand reflected on his life. He had no regrets, indeed he felt that \\nhe had been extremely lucky. Whatever the reason, the course \\nhe had chosen ten years ago had proved to be right for him. \\nHe was successful, he was as happy as any grown man could \\nreasonably expect, and he found life interesting. \\n\\nTom Hagen was thirty-five years old, a tall crew-cut man, \\nvery slender, very ordinary-looking. He was a lawyer but did \\nnot do the actual detailed legal work for the Corleone family \\nbusiness though he had practised law for three years after \\npassing the bar exsm. \\n\\nAt the age of eleven he had been a playmate of eleven-year \\nold Sonny Corleone. Hagen’s mother had gone blind and then \\ndied during his eleventh year. Hagen’s father, a heavy drinker, \\nhad become a hopeless drunkard. A hard-working carpenter, \\nhe had never done a dishonest thing in his life. But his drinking \\ndestroyed his family and finally killed him. Tom Hagen was \\nleft an orphan who wandered the streets and slept in hallways. \\nHis younger sister had been put in a foster home, but in the \\n1 920s the social agencies did not follow up cases of twelve- \\nyear-old boys who were so ungrateful as to run from their \\ncharity. Hagen, too, had an eye infection. Neighbours whis- \\npered that he had caught or inherited it from his mother and so \\ntherefore it could be caught from him. He was shunned. Sonny \\nCorleone, a warmhearted and imperious eleven-year-old, had \\nbrought his friend home and demanded that he be taken in. \\nTom Hagen was given a hot dish of spaghetti with oily rich \\ntomato sauce, the taste of which he had never forgotten, and \\nthen given a metal folding bed to sleep on. « \\n\\nIn the most natural way, without a word being spoken or \\nthe matter discussed in any feshion, Don Corleone had per- \\nmitted the boy to stay in his household. Don Corleone himself \\ntook the boy to a special doctor and had his eye infection \\ncured. He sent him to college and law school. In all this the \\nDon acted not as a father but rather as a guardian. There was \\nno show of afiection but oddly enough the Don treated Hagen \\nmore courteously than his own sons, did not impose a parental \\nwill upon him. It was the boy’s decision to go tp law school \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nafter college. He bad heard Don G>rleoiie say once, lawyer \\nwith his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with \\nguns.’ Meanwhile, much to the annoyance of their father. \\nSonny and Freddie insisted on going into the family business \\nafter graduation from high school. Only Michael had gone on \\nto college, and he had enlisted in the Marines the day after \\nPearl Harbor. \\n\\nAfter he passed the bar eaatn, Hagen married to start his \\nown family. The bride was a young Italian girl from New \\nJersey, rare at that time for being a college graduate. After the \\nwedding, which was of course held in the home of Don \\nCorlcone, the Don offered to support Hagen in any under- \\ntaking he desired, to send him law clients, furnish his oftice, \\nstart him in real estate. \\n\\nTom Hagen had bowed his head and said to the Don, ’I \\nwould like to work for you.’ \\n\\nThe Don was surprised, yet pleased. ‘You know who I am? ’ \\nhe asked. \\n\\nHagen nodded. He hadn’t really known the extent of the \\nDon’s power, not then. He did not really know m the ten \\nyears that followed until he was made the acting Consiguori \\nafter Genco Abbandando became ill. But he nodded and met \\nthe Don’s eyes with his own. ‘I would work for you like your \\nsons,’ Hagen said, meaning with complete loyalty, with com- \\nplete acceptance of the Don’s parental divinity. The Don, with \\nthat understanding which was even then building the legend \\nof his greatness, showed the young man the first mark ofr \\nfstherly affection since he had come into his household. He \\ntook Hagen into his arms for a quick embrace and afterwards \\ntreated him more like a true son, though he would sometimes \\nsay, ‘Tbm, never forget your parents,’ as if he were reminding \\nhimself as well as Hagen. \\n\\nThere was no chance that Hagen would forget. His mother \\nhad been near moronic and slovenly, so ridden by anaemia she \\ncould not feel affection for her children or make a pretence of \\nit. His father Hagen had hated. His mother’s blindness before \\nshe died had terriff ed him and his own eye infection had been a \\nstroke of doom. He had been sure he would go blind. When \\nhis father died, Tom Hagen’s eleven-year-old mind had \\n\\n\\n54 \\n\\n\\n\\nsnapped in a curious way. He had roamed the streets like an \\nanimal waiting for death until the fateful day Sonny found him \\nsleeping in the back of a hallway and brought him to his home. \\nWhat had happened afterwards was a miracle. But for years \\nHagen had had nightmares, dreaming he had grown to man- \\nhood blind, tapping a white cane, his blind children behind \\nhim tap-tapping with their little white canes as they begged in \\nthe streets. Some mornings when he woke the face of Don \\nQ>rlcone was imprinted on his brain in that first conscious \\nmoment and he would feel safe. \\n\\nBut the Don had insisted that he put in three years of general \\nlaw practice in addition to his duties for the family business. \\nThis experience had proved invaluable later on, and also re- \\nmoved any doubts in Hagen’s mind about working for Don \\nCorleone. He had then spent two years of training in the offices \\nof a top firm of criminal law\\'yers in which the Don had some \\ninfluence. It was apparent to everyone that he had a flair for \\nthis branch of the law. He did well and when be went into the \\nfull-time service of the family business, Don Corleone had not \\nbeen able to reproach him once in the six years that followed. \\n\\nWhen he had been made the acting Consigliori, the other \\npowerful Sicilian families referred contemptuously to the Cor- \\nleone family as the * Irish gang’. This had amused Hagen. It \\nhad also taught him that he could never hope to succeed the \\nDon as the head of the fiunily business. But he was content. \\nThat had never been his goal, such an ambition would have \\nbeen a \\'disrespect’ to his benefiictor and his benefactor’s \\nblood family. \\n\\nIt was still dark when the plane landed in Loa Angeles. \\nHagen checked into his hotel, showered and shaved, and \\nwatclied dawn come over the dty. He ordered breakfast and \\nnewspapers to be sent up to his room and relaxed undl it was \\ntime for his ten am appointment with Jack Woltz. The ap- \\npointment had been surprisingly easy to make. \\n\\nThe day before, Hagen had c^ed the most powerful man in \\nthe movie labour unions, a man named Billy Gofl. Acting on \\ninstructions from Don Corleone, Hagen had told Go£F to \\narrange an appointment on the next day for Hagen to call on \\n\\n\\n55 \\n\\n\\n\\nJack Woltz, that he should hint to Woltz diat if Hagen was not \\nmade happy by the results of the interview, there could be a \\nlabour strike at the movie studio. An hour later Hagen re- \\nceived a call from Goff. The appointment would be at ten \\nAM. Woltz had got the message about the possible labour \\nstrike but hadn’t seemed too impressed, GofiF said. He added, \\n‘If it really comes down to tl:^t, 1 gotta talk to the Don \\nmyself.’ \\n\\n‘If it comes to that he’ll talk to you,’ Hagen said. By saying \\nthis he avoided making any promises. He was not surprised \\nthat GoflF was so agreeable to the Don’s wishes. The family \\nempire, technically, did not extend beyond the New York area \\nbut Don CorleoiiC had first become strong by helping labour \\nleaders. Many of them still owed him debts of friendship. \\n\\nBut the ten am appointment was a bad sign. It meant that he \\nwould be first on the appointment list, that he would not be \\ninvited to lunch. It meant that Woltz held him in small worth. \\nGoff had not been threatening enough, probably because \\nWoltz had him on his graft payroll. And sometimes the Don’s \\nsuccess in keeping himself out of the limelight worked to the \\ndisadvantage of the family business, in that his name did not \\nmean anything to outside circles. \\n\\nHis analysis proved correct. Woltz kept him waiting for a \\nhalf liour past the appointed time. Hagen didn’t mind. The \\nreception room was very plush, very comfortable, and on a \\nplum-coloured couch opposite him sat the most beautiful child \\nHagen had ever seen. She was no more than eleven or twelve, \\ndressed in a very expensive but simple way as a grown woman. \\nShe had incredibly golden hair, huge deep sea-blue eyes and a \\nfresh raspberry-red mouth. She was guarded by a woman \\nobviously her mother, who tried to stare Hagen down with a \\ncold arrogance that made him want to punch her in the face. \\nThe angel child and the dragon mother, Hagen thought, \\nreturning the mother’s cold stare. \\n\\nFinally an exquisitely dressed but stout middle-aged woman \\ncame to lead him through a string of offices to the office-apart- \\nment of the movie producer. Hagen was impressed by the \\nbeauty of the offices and the people working in them. He \\nsmiled. They were all shrewdies, trying to get their foot in the \\n\\n\\n54 \\n\\n\\n\\nmovie door by taking office jobs, and most of them would \\nwork in these offices for the rest of their lives or until they \\naccepted defeat and returned to their home towns. \\n\\nJack Woltz was a tall, powerfully built man with a heavy \\npaunch almost concealed by his perfectly tailored suit. Hagen \\nknew his history. At ten years of age Woltz had hustled empty \\nbeer kegs and pushcarts on the East Side. At twenty he helped \\nhis father sweat garment workers. At thirty he had left New \\nYork and moved West, invested in the nickelodeon, and \\npioneered motion pictures. At forty-eight he had been the \\nmost powerful movie magnate in Hollywood, still rough- \\nspoken, rapaciously amorous, a raging wolf ravaging helpless \\nflocks of young starlets. At fifty he transformed himself. He \\ntook speech lessons, learned how to dress from an English \\nvalet, and how to behave socially from an English buder. \\nWhen his first wife died he married a world-famous and beaud- \\nful actress who didn’t like acting. Now at the age of sixty he \\ncollected old master paintings, was a member of the President’s \\nAdvisory Committee, and had set up a multimillion-doUar \\nfoimdadon in his name to promote art in modon pictures. His \\ndaughter had married an English lord, his son an Italian \\nprincess. \\n\\nHis latest passion, as reported dutifully by every movie \\ncolumnist in America, was his own racing stables on which he \\nhad spent ten million dollars in the past year. He had made \\nheadlines by purchasing the funed English racing horse \\nKhartoum for the incredible price of six hundred thousand \\ndollars and then announcing that the undefeated racer would \\nbe retired and put to stud exclusively for the Woltz stables. \\n\\nHe received Hagen courteously, his beautifi^y, evenly \\ntanned, meticulously barbered flsce contorted with a grimace \\nmeant to be a smile. Despite all the money spent, despite die \\nministradons of the most knowledgeable technicians, his age \\nshowed; the flesh of his face looked as if it had been seamed \\ntogether. But there was an enormous vitality in his movements \\nand he had what Don Corleone had, the air of a man who \\ncommanded absolutely the world in which he lived. \\n\\nHagen came direedy to the point. That he was an emissary \\nftx>m a fnend of Johnny Fontane. That this friend was a very \\n\\n\\n55 \\n\\n\\n\\npowerful man who would pledge his gratitude and undying \\nfriendship to Mr Woitz if Mr Woltz would grant a small \\nfavour. The small favour would be the casting of Johnny \\nFontane in the new war movie the studio planned to start next \\nweek. \\n\\nThe seamed face was impassive^ polite. ‘What favours can \\nyour friend do me?’ Woltz asked. There was just a trace of \\ncondescension in his voice. \\n\\nHagen ignored the condescension. He explained. ‘You’ve \\ngot some labour trouble coming up. My friend can absolutely \\nguarantee to make that trouble disappear. You have a top \\nmalc\\'star who makes a lot of money for your studio but he just \\ngraduated from marijuana to heroin. My friend wili guarantee \\nthat your male star won’t be able to get any more heroin. And \\nif some other little thmgs come up over the years a phone call \\nto me can solve your problems.’ \\n\\nJack Woltz listened to this as if he were hearmg the boasting \\nof a child. Then he said harshly, his voice deliberately ail Bast \\nSide, ‘You trying to put muscle on me?’ \\n\\nHagen said coolly, ‘Absolutely not. I’ve come to ask a \\nservice for a friend. I’ve tried to explain that you won’t lose \\nan 3 rthing by it.* \\n\\nAlmost as if he willed it, Woltz made his face a mask of \\nanger. The mouth curled, his heavy brows, dyed black, con- \\ntracted to form a thick line over his glinting eyes. He leaned \\nover the desk towards Hagen. ‘All right, you smooth son of a \\nbitch, let me lay it on the line for you and your boss, whoever \\nhe is. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don’t care how \\nmany guinea Mafia goombahs come out of the woodwork.\\' \\nHe leaned back. ‘A word of advice to you, my friend. J. Edgar \\nHoovcf, 1 assume you’ve heard of him ’ - Woltz smiled sar- \\ndonically - \\' IS a personal friend of mine. If I let him know I’m \\nbeing pressured, you guys will never know what hit you.’ \\n\\nHagen listened patiently. He had expected better from a man \\nof Woltz’s stature. Was it possible that a man who acted this \\nstupidly could rise to the head of a company worth hundreds \\nof millions ? That was something to think about since the Don \\nwas looking for new things to put money into, and if the top \\nbrains of this industry were so dumb, movies might be the \\n\\n56 \\n\\n\\n\\nthing. The abuse itself bothered him not at all. Hagen had \\nlearned the art of negotiation from the Don himself. ‘ Nevet \\nget angry,’ the Don had instructed. ‘Never make a threat. \\nReason with people.’ The word ‘reason’ sounded so much \\nbettei in Italian, rajmahy to rejom. The art of dus was to ignore \\nall insults, all threats; to turn the othet cheek. Hagen had seeii \\nthe Don sii at a negotiating table for eight hours, swallowing \\ninsults, trying to persuade a notorious and megalomaniac \\nstrong-arm man to mend his ways. At the end of the eight \\nhours Don Corleone had thrown up his hands in a helpless \\ngesture and said to the other men at the table, ‘ But no one can \\nreason with this fellow,’ and had stalked out of the meeting \\nroom. The strong-arm man had turned white with fear, \\ntsmis&aries were sent to bring the I^ori back into the room. An \\nagreement was reached but two months later the strong-arm \\nman was shot to death in his favourite barbershop. \\n\\nSo Plagen started again, speaking in the most ordinary voice. \\n‘Look at my card,’ he said. ‘I’m a lawyer. Would I stick my \\nneck out? Have I uttered one threatening word? Let me just \\nsay that I am prepared to meet any condition you name to get \\nJohnny Fontane that movie. 1 think I’ve already offered a great \\ndeal for such a small favour. A favour that I understand it \\nwould be in your interest to grant. Johnny tells me that you \\nadmit he would be perfect for that part. And let me say that \\nthis favour would never be asked if that were not so. In fact, if \\nyou\\'re worried about your investment, my client would \\nfinance the picture. But please let me make myself absolutely \\nclear. Wc understand your no is no. Nobody can force you or \\nis trying to. Wc know about your friendship with Mr Hoover, \\nI may add, and my boss respects you for it. He respects that \\nrelationship very much.’ \\n\\nWoltz had been doodling with a huge, red-feathered pen. At \\nthe mention of money his interest was aroused and he stopped \\ndoodling. He said patronizingly, ‘This picture is budgeted at \\nfive million.’ \\n\\nHagen whistled softly to show that he was impressed. Then \\nhe said very casually, ‘My boss has a lot of friends who back \\nhis judgement.’ \\n\\nFor the first time Woltz seemed to take the whole thing \\n\\n57 \\n\\n\\n\\nseriously. He studied Hagen’s card. ‘I never heard of you/ he \\nsaid. ‘I know most of the big lawyers in New York, but just \\nwho the hell are you?’ \\n\\n‘I have one of those dignified corporate practices,’ Hagen \\nsaid dryly. ‘I just handle this one account.’ He rose, ‘I won’t \\ntake up any more of your time.’ He held out his hand, Woltz \\nshook it. Hagen took a few steps towards the door and turned \\nto face Woltz again. ‘ I understand you have to deal with a lot \\nof people who try to seem more important than they are. In \\nmy case the reverse is true. Why don’t you check me out with \\nour mutual friend? If you reconsider, call me at my hotel.* He \\npaused. ‘This may be sacrilege to you, but my client can do \\nthings for you that even Mr Hoover might find out of his \\nrange.* He saw the movie producer’s eyes narrowing. Woltz \\nwas finally getting the message. ‘By the way, 1 admire your \\npictures very much,’ Hagen said in the most fawning voice he \\ncould manage. ‘I hope you can keep up the good work. Our \\ncountry needs it.* \\n\\nLate that afternoon Hagen received a call from the pro- \\nducer’s secretary that a car would pick him up within the hour \\nto take him out to Mr Woltz’s country home for dinner. She \\ntold him it would be about a three-hour drive but that the car \\nwas equipped with a bar and some hors d’oeuvres. Hagen \\nknew that Woltz made the trip in his private plane and \\nwondered why he hadn’t been invited to make the trip by air. \\nThe secretary’s voice was adding politely, ‘ Mr Woltz suggested \\nyou bring an overnight bag and he’ll get you to the airport in \\nthe morning.’ \\n\\n‘I’ll do that,’ Hagen said. That was another thing to wonder \\nabout. How did Woltz know he was taking the morning plane \\nback tb New York? He thought about it for a moment. The \\nmost likely explanation was that Woltz had set private de- \\ntectives on his trail to get all possible information. Then Woltz \\ncertainly knew he represent^ the Don, which meant that he \\nknew something about the Don, which in turn meant that he \\nwas now ready to take the whole matter seriously. Something \\nmight be done after all, Hagen thought. And maybe Woltz \\nwas smarter than he had appoired this morning. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe home of Jack Wolt 2 looked likc^ an implausible movie \\nset. There was a plantation-type mansion, huge grounds \\ngirdled by a rich black dirt bridle path, stables and pasture for \\na herd of horses. The hedges, flower beds, and grasses were as \\ncarefully manicured as a movie star’s nails. \\n\\nWolta greeted Hagen on a glass-panel air-conditioned porch. \\nThe producer was informally dressed in blue silk shirt open at \\nthe neck, mustard-coloured slacks, soft leather sandals. \\nFramed in all this colour and rich flibric his seamed, tough face \\nWas startling. He handed Hagen an outsked martini glass and \\ntook one for himself from the prepared tray. He seemed more \\nfriendly than he had been earlier in the day. He put his arm \\nover Hagen’s shoulder and said, * We have a little time before \\ndinner, let’s go look at my horses.’ As they walked towards the \\nstables he said, \"1 checked you out, Tom; you should have \\ntold me your boss is Corleone. 1 thought you were just some \\nthird-rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. And I \\ndon’t blufl. Not that I want to make enemies, 1 never believed \\nin that. But let’s just enjoy ourselves now. We can talk \\nbusiness after dinner.’ \\n\\nSurprisingly Woitz proved to be a truly considerate host. \\nHe explained his new methods, innovations that he hoped \\nwould make his stable the most successful in America. The \\nstables were all fire-proofed, sanitked to the highest degree, \\nand guarded by a special security detail of private detectives. \\nFinaUy Woitz led him to a stall which had a huge bronze \\nplaque attached to its outside wall. On the plaque was the \\nname ^Khartoum’. \\n\\nThe horse inside the stall was, even to Hagen’s inex- \\nperienced eyes, a beautiful animal. Khartoum’s skin was jet \\nblack except for a diamond-shaped white patch on his huge \\nforehead. The great brown eyes glinted like golden apples, the \\nblack skin over the taut body was silk. Woitz said with childish \\npride, ‘The greatest racehorse in the world. I bought him in \\nEngland last year for six hundred grand. I bet even the \\nRussian Czars never paid that much for a single horse. But I’m \\nnot going to race hixn, I’m going to put him to stud. Fm going \\nto build the greatest racing stable this country has ever \\nknown.’ He stroked die horse^s mane and called out sofdy, \\n\\n\\n59 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Khartoum, Khartoum.* There was real love in his voice and \\nthe animal responded. Woltz said to Hagen, \\'Tm a good \\nhorseman, you know, and the first time 1 ever rode I was fifty \\nyears old.* He laughed. \\'Maybe one of my grandmothers in \\nRussia got raped by a G)ssack and I got his blood.* He tickled \\nKhartoum’s belly and said with sincere admiration, ‘ Look at \\nthat cock on him. 1 should have such a cock.* \\n\\nThey went back to the mansion to have dinner. It was served \\nby three waiters under the command of a butler, the table \\nlinen and ware were all gold thread and silver, but Hagen \\nfound the food mediocre. Woltz obviously lived alone, and \\njust as obviously was not a man who cared about food. Hagen \\nwaited until they had both lit up huge Havana cigars before he \\nasked Woltz, ‘Does Johnny get it or not?’ \\n\\n‘I can’t,* Woltz said. ‘I can’t put Johnny into that picture \\neven if I wanted to. The contracts arc all signed for all the \\nperformers and the cameras roll next week. There’s no way I \\ncan swing it.’ \\n\\nHagen said impatiently, ‘Mr Woltz, the big advantage of \\ndealing with a man at the top is that such an excuse is not valid. \\nYou can do anything you want to do.* He puffed on his cigar. \\n‘ Don’t you believe my client * 2 ah keep his promises ? ’ \\n\\nWoltz said dryly, ‘I believe that I’m going to have labour \\ntrouble. Goff called me up on that, the son of a bitch, and the \\nway he talked to me you’d never guess I pay him a hundred \\ngrand a year under the table. And I believe you can get that \\nfag he-man star of mine off heroin. But I don’t care about that \\nand 1 can finance my own pictures. Because 1 hate that bastard \\nFontane. Tell your boss tliis is one favour 1 can’t give but that \\nhe should try me again on anything else. Anything at all.’ \\n\\nHagdn tliought, you sneaky bastard, then why the hell did \\nyou bring me all the way out here? The producer had some- \\nthing on his mind. Hagen said coldly, ‘I don’t think you \\nunderstand the situation. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontanc’s \\ngodfather. That is a very close, a very sacred religious relation- \\nship.* Woltz bowed his head in respect at this reference to re- \\nligion. Hagen went on. ‘Italians have a little joke, that the \\nworld is so hard a man must have two fathers to look after \\nhim, and that’s why they have godfathers. Since Johnny’s \\n\\n6o \\n\\n\\n\\nfather died, Mr Corleone feels his responsibility even more \\ndeeply. As for trying you again, Mr Corleone is much too \\nsensitive. He never asks a second favour where he has been \\nrefused the first/ \\n\\nWoltz shrugged. ‘Tm sorry. The answer is still no. But since \\nyou\\'^rc here, what will it cost me to have that labour trouble \\ncleared up? In czsh. Right now.\\' \\n\\nThat solved one puzzle for Hagen. Why Woltz was putting \\nin so much time on him when he had already decided not to \\ngive Johnny the part. And that could not be changed at this \\nmteeting. Woltz felt secure; he was not afraid of the power of \\nDon Corleone. And certainly Woltz with his national political \\nconnexions, his acquaintanceship with the FBI chief, his \\nhuge personal fortune, and his absolute power in the film \\nindustry, could not feel threatened by Don Corleone. To any \\nintelligent man, even to Hagen, it seemed that Woltz had \\ncorrectly assessed his position. He was impregnable to the Don \\nif he was willing to take the losses the labour struggle would \\ncost. There was only one thing wrong with the whole equa- \\ntion. Don Corleone liad promised his godson he would get the \\npart and Don Corleone had never, to Hagen\\'s knowledge, \\nbroken his word in such matters. \\n\\nHagen said quietly, * You arc deliberately misimdcrstanding \\nme. You are trying to make me an accomplice to extortion. Mr \\nCorleone promises only to .speak in your favour on this labour \\ntrouble as a Oiatter of friendsnip in return for your speaking in \\nbehalf of liis client. A friendly exchange of influence, nothing \\nmore. But 1 can see you don\\'t take me seriously. Personally, 1 \\nthink that is a mistake.\\' \\n\\nWoltz. as if he had been waiting for such a moment, let him- \\nself get angry. ‘I understood perfectly,\\' he said, ‘that\\'s the \\nMafia style, isn\\'t it? All oiivc oil and sweet talk when what \\nyou\\'re really doing is making threats. So let me lay it on the \\nline. Johnny Fontana will never get that part and he’s perfect \\nfor it. It would make him a great star. But he never will be \\nbecause I hate that pinko punk and I’m going to run him out of \\nthe movies. And I\\'ll tell you why. He ruined one of my most \\nvaluable profegdes. For five years 1 had this girl under train- \\ning, singing, dancing, acting lessons, I spent hundreds of \\n\\n6i \\n\\n\\n\\nthousands of dollars. I was going to make her a star. I’ll be even \\nmore frank, just to show you that I’m not a hard-hearted man, \\nthat it wasn’t all dollars and cents. That girl was beautiful and \\nshe was the greatest piece of ass I’ve ever had and I’ve had them \\nall over the world. She could suck you out like a water pump. \\nThen Johnny comes along with that olive-oil voice and guinea \\ncharm and she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me \\nridiculous. A man in my position, Mr Hagen, can’t afford to \\nlook ridiculous. I have to pay Johnny off.’ \\n\\nFor the first time, Woltz succeeded in astounding Hagen. \\nHe found it inconceivable that a grown man of substance \\nwould let such trivialities affect his judgement in an affair of \\nbusiness, and one of such importance. In Hagen’s world, the \\nCorlcones’ world, the physical beauty, the sexual power of \\nwomen, carried not the slightest weight in worldly matters. It \\nwas a private affair, except, of course, in matters of marriage \\nand family disgrace. Hagen decided to make one last try. \\n\\n‘You are absolutely right, Mr Woltz,’ Hagen said. ‘But are \\nyour grievances that major? I don’t think you’ve understood \\nhow important this very small favour is to my client. Mr \\nCorleone held the infant Johnny in his arms when he was \\nbaptized. When Johnny’s father died, Mr Q>rleone assumed \\nthe duties of parenthood, indeed he is called “Godfather” by \\nmany people who wish to show their respect and gratitude for \\nthe help he has given them, Mr Corleone never lets his friends \\ndown.’ \\n\\nWoltz stood ^p abruptly. ‘I’ve listened to about enough. \\nThugs don’t give me orders, I give them orders. If I pick up \\nthis phone, you’ll spend the night in jail. And if that Mafia \\ngoombah tries any rough stuff, he’ll find out I’m not a band \\nleader. Yeah, I heard that story too. Listen, your Mr Corleone \\nwill never know what hit him. Even if I have to use my \\ninfluence at the White House.’ \\n\\nThe stupid, stupid son of a bitch. How the hell did he get to \\nbe a pev^nwantty Hagen wondered. Advisor to the President, \\nhead of the biggest movie studio in the world. Definitely the \\nDon should get into the movie business. And the guy was \\ntaking his words at their sentimental face value. He was not \\ngetting the message. \\n\\n\\n6i \\n\\n\\n\\n*Thank yoa for the dimier and a pleasant evening,’ Hagen \\nsaid. \\'Could you give me transportation to the airport? 1 don’t \\nthink I’ll spend the night.’ He smiled coldly at Wolt 2 . \\'Mr \\nCorleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news at once/ \\n\\nWhile waiting in the floodlit colonnade of the mansion for \\nhis car, Hagen saw two women about to enter a long limousine \\nalready parked in the driveway. They were the beautiful \\ntwelve-year-old blonde girl and her mother ^e had seen in \\nWoltz’s oflice that morning. But now the girl’s exquisitely cut \\nmouth seemed to have smeared into a thick, pink mass. Her \\nsea-blue eyes were Aimed over and when she walked down the \\nsteps towards the open car her long legs tottered like a crippled \\nfoal’s. Her mother supported the child, helping her into the \\ncar, hissing commands into her ear. The mother’s head turned \\nfor a quick furtive look at Hagen and he saw in her eyes a \\nburning, hawklike triumph. Then she too disappeared into the \\nlimousine. \\n\\nSo that was why he hadn’t got the plane ride from Los \\nAngeles, Hagen thought. The girl and her mother had made \\nthe trip with the movie producer. That had given Woltz \\nenough time to relax before dinner and do the job on the little \\nkid. And Johnny wanted to live in this world? Good luck to \\nhim, and good luck to Woltz. \\n\\nPaulie Gatto hated quickie jobs, especially when they in- \\nvolved violence. He liked to plan things ahead. And some- \\nthing like tonight, even though it was punk stuff, could turn \\ninto serious business if somebody made a mistake. Now, \\nsipping his beer, he glanced around, checking how the two \\nyoung punks were making out with the two little tramps at the \\nbar. \\n\\nPaulie Gatto knew everything there was to know about \\nthose two punks. Their names were Jerry Wagner and Kevin \\nMoonan. They were both about twenty years old, good-look- \\ning, brown-haired, tall, well-built. Both were due to go back \\nto college out of town in two weeks, both had fathers with \\npolitical influence and this, with their college student classifi- \\ncation, had so far kept them out of the draft. Hiey were both \\nalso under suspended sentences for assaulting the daughter of \\n\\n65 \\n\\n\\n\\nAmerigo Bonasera. The lou87 bastards, Paulic Gatto thought. \\nDraft dodging, violating their probation by drinking in a \\nbar after midnight, chasing floozies. Young punks. Paulie \\nGatto had been deferred from the draft himself because \\nhis doctor had furnished the draft board with documents \\nshowing that this patient, male, white, aged twenty-six, un- \\nmarried, had received electrical shock treatments for a mental \\ncondition. All false of course, but Paulie Gatto felt that he \\nbad earned his draft exemption. It had been arranged by \\nCiemenza after Gatto had ‘made his bones’ in the family \\nbusiness. \\n\\nIt was Ciemenza who had told him that this job must be. \\nrashed through, before the boys went to college. Why the hell \\ndid it have to be done in New York, Gatto wondered. Clc- \\nmenza was always giving extra orders instead of just giving \\nout the job. Now if those two little tramps walked out with \\nthe punks it would be another night wasted. \\n\\nHe could hear one of the girls laughing and saying, ‘Are you \\ncrazy, Jerry? Tm not going in any car with you. i don\\'t want \\nto wind up in the hospital like that other poor girl.’ Her voice \\nwas spitefully rich with satisfaction. That was enough for \\nGatto, He finished up his beer and walked out into the dark \\nstreet. Perfect. It was after midnight. There was only one other \\nbar that showed light. The rest of the stores were closed. The \\nprecinct patrol car had been taken care of by Ciemenza. They \\nwouldn’t be aiound that way until they got a radio call and \\nthen they’d come slow. \\n\\nHe leaned against the four-door Chevy sedan. In the back \\nscat two men were sitting, almost invisible, although they \\nwere very big men. Paulie said, ‘Take them when they come \\nout.’ \\n\\nHe still thought it had all been set up too fast. Ciemenza had \\ngiven him copies ot the police mug shots of the two punks, the \\ndope on where the punks went drinking every ni ght to pick up \\nbar girls. Paulie had recruited two of the strong-arms in the \\nfamily and fingered the punks for them. He had also given \\nthem their instructions. No blows on the top or the back of the \\nhead, there was to be no accidental fetality. Other «-han that \\nthey could go as far as they liked. He bad given them only one \\n\\n64 \\n\\n\\n\\nwarning; *If those punks get out of the hospital in less than a \\nmonth, you guys go back to driving trucks/ \\n\\nThe two big men were getting out of the car. They were \\nboth ex-boxers who Had never made it past the small clubs and \\nhad been fixed up by Sonny Corleone with a little loan-shark \\naction so that they could make a decent living. They were, \\nnaturally, anxious to show their gratitude. \\n\\nWhen Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan came out of the bar \\nthey were perfect setups. The bar girl’s taunts had left their \\nadolescent vanity prickly. Paulie Gatto, leaning against the \\nfender of his car, called out to them with a teasing laugh, \\n‘Hey, Casanova, those broads really brushed you off.’ \\n\\nThe two young men turned on him with delight. Paulie \\nGatto looked like a perfect outlet for their humiliation. Ferret- \\nfaced, short, slightly built, and a wise guy in the bargain. They \\npounced on him eagerly and immediately found their arms \\npinned by two men grabbing them from behind. At the same \\nmoment Paulie Gatto had slipped onto his right hand, a \\nspecially made set of brass knuckles studded with one- \\nsixteenth-inch iron spikes. His timing was good, he worked \\nout in the gym three times a week. He smashed the punk \\nnamed Wagner right on the nose. The man holding Wagner \\nlifted him up off the ground and Paulie swung his arm, \\nuppercutting ii^to the perfectly positioned groin. Wagner \\nwent Ump and the big man dropped him« This had taken no \\nmore than six seconds. \\n\\nNow both of them turned their attention to Kevin Moonan, \\nwho was trying to shout. The man holding him from behind \\ndid so easily with one huge muscled arm. The other hand he \\nput around Moonan ’s throat to cut off any sound. , \\n\\nPaulie Gatto jumped into the car and started the motor. The \\ntwo big men were beating Moonan to jelly. They did so with \\n(ngbtening deliberation, as if they bad all the time in the \\nworld. They did not throw punches in flurries but in timed, \\nslow-motion sequences that carried the full weight of their \\nmassive bodies. Each blow landed with a jp/a/ of flesh \\nsplitting open. Gatto got a glimpse of Moonan^s face. It was \\nThe two mea ieft Mooaaa lying on the a\\'dc- \\n\\n»n tufned tbeir atteatim to Wagaer. Wagaer waa tryiag \\n\\n\\n\\nto get to his feet and he started to scream for help. Someone \\ncame out of the bar and the two men had to work faster now. \\nThey clubbed Wagner to his knees. One of the men took his \\narm and twisted it, then kicked him in the spine. There was a \\ncracking sound and Wagner’s scream of agony brought \\nwindows open all along the street. The two men worked very \\nquickly. One of them held Wagner up by using his two hands \\naround Wagner’s head like a vice. The other man smashed his \\nhuge fist into the fixed target. There were more people coming \\nout of the bar but none tried to interfere. Paulie Gatto yelled, \\n‘ Come on, enough.* \\'Hie two big men jumped into the car and \\nPaulie gunned it away. Somebody would describe the car and \\nread the licence plates but it didn’t matter. It was a stolen \\nCalifornia plate and there were one hundred thousand black \\nChevy sedans in New York City. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER^TWO \\n\\n\\nTom Hagen went to his law office in the city on Thursday \\nmorning. He planned to catch up on his paper work so as to \\nhave ever3rthing cleared away for the meeting with Virgd \\nSollozao on Friday. A meeting of such importance that he had \\nasked the Don for a full evening of talk to prepare for the \\nproposition they knew SoUozzo would offer the family \\nbusiness. Hagen wanted to have all little details cleared away \\nso that he could go to that preparatory meeting with an \\nunencumbered mind. \\n\\nThe Don had not seemed surprised when Hagen returned \\nfrom California late Tuesday evening and told him the results \\nof the negotiations with Woltz. He had made Hagen go over \\nevery detail and grimaced with distaste when Hagen told about \\nthe beautiful little girl and her mother. He had murmured \\n^ inf amiia \\\\ his strongest disapproval. He had asked Hagen one \\nfinal question. ^Does this man have real balls?’ \\n\\nHagen considered exactly what the Don meant by this \\nquestion. Over the years he had learned that the Don’s values \\n\\n66 \\n\\n\\n\\nwere so different from those of most people that his words also \\ncould have a different meaning. Did Woltz have character? \\nDid he have a strong will ? He most certainly did, but that was \\nnot what the Don was asking. Did the movie producer have \\nthe courage not to be bluffed? Did he have the willingness to \\nsuffer heavy financial loss delay on his movies would mean, \\nthe scandal of his big star exposed as a user of heroin? Again \\nthe answer was yes. But again this was not what the Don \\nmeant. Finally Hagen translated the question properly in his \\nmind. Did Jack Woltz have the balls to risk everything, to run \\nthe chance of losing all on a matter of principle, on a matter of \\nhonour; for revenge? \\n\\nHagen smiled. He did it rarely but now he could not resist \\njesting with the Don. ‘ You*re asking if he is a Sicilian.* Tlic \\nDon nodded his head pleasantly, acknowledging the flattering \\nwitticism and its truth. *No,* Hagen said. \\n\\nThat had been all. The Don had pondered the question until \\nthe next day. On Wednesday afternoon he had called Hagen to \\nhis home and given him his instructions. The instructions liad \\nconsumed the rest of Hagen’s working day and left him dazed \\nwith admiration. There was no question in his mind that the \\nDon had solved the problem, that Woltz would call him this \\nmorning with the news that Johnny Fontane had the starring \\npart in his new war movie. \\n\\nAt that moment the phone did ring but it was Amerigo \\nBonasera. The undertaker’s voice was trembling with grati- \\ntude. He wanted Hagen to convey to the Don his undying \\nfriendship. The Don had only to call on him. He, Amerigo \\nBonasera, would lay down his life for the blessed Godfather. \\nHagen assured him that the Don would be told. \\n\\nThe Daily News had carried a middle-page spread of Jerry \\nWagner and Kevin Moonan lying in the street. The photos \\nwere expertly gruesome, they seemed to be pulps of human \\nbeings. Miraculously, said the News^ they were both still alive \\nthough they would both be in the hospital for months and \\nwould require plastic surgery. Hagen made a note to tell \\nQemenza that something should be done for Paulie Gatto. He \\nseemed to know his job. \\n\\nHagen worked quickly and efficiently for the next three \\n\\n67 \\n\\n\\n\\nhours qonsolidating eaming reports £com die Don’s teal estate \\ncompany, his olive oil importing business, and his coostrucdon \\nfirm. None of them were doing well but with the war over \\nthey should all become rich producers. He had almost for- \\ngotten the Johnny Fontane problem when his secretary told \\nhim Gilifornia was calling. He felt a little thrill of antidpadoo \\nas he picked up the phone and said, * Hagen here. ’ \\n\\nThe voice that came over the phone was unrecogniaable \\nwith hate and passion. * You fucking bastard,’ Woltz screamed. \\n*ril have you all in jail for a hunted years. I’ll spend every \\npenny 1 have to get you. I’ll get that Johnny Fontane’s balls \\ncut oflf, do you hear me, you guinea fiick?’ \\n\\nHagen said kindly, ‘I’m German-Irish.* There was a long \\npause and then a click of the phone being hung up. Hagen \\nsmiled. Not once had Woltz uttered a threat against Don \\nCorleone himself. Genius had its rewards. \\n\\nJack Woltz always slept alone. He had a bed big enough for \\nten people and a bedroom large enough for a movie ballroom \\nscene, but he had slept alone since the death of his first wife \\nten years before. This did not mean he no longer used women. \\nHe was physically a vigorous man despite his age, but he could \\nbe aroused now only by very young girls and had learned that \\na few hours in the evening were all the youth of his body and \\nhis patience could tolerate. \\n\\nOn this Thursday morning, for some reason, he awoke \\nearly. The light of ^wn made his huge bedroom as misty as \\na foggy meadow-land. Far down at the foot of his bed was \\na familiar shape and Woltz struggled up on his elbows to \\nget a clearer look. It had the sl^pe of a horse’s head. Still \\ngroggy, Woltz reached and flicked on the night table lamp. \\n\\nThe shock of what he saw made him physically ill. It \\nseemed as if a great sledgehammer had struck him on the chest, \\nhis heartbeat jumped erratically and he became nauseous. His \\nvomit spluttered on the thick flair rug. \\n\\nSevered from its body, the black silky head of the great \\nhorse Khartoum was stuck fast in a thick cake of blood. White \\nreedy tendons showed. Froth covered the muzzle and those \\napple-sized eyes that had glinted Uke gold were mottled the \\n\\n68 \\n\\n\\n\\ncolour of rotdng fruit with dead, haemorrhaged blood. \\nWoltz was struck by a purely animal terror and out of that \\nterror he screamed for his servants and out of that terror he \\ncalled Hagen to make his uncontrolled threats. His maniacal \\nraving alarmed the butler, who called Woltz’s personal \\nphysician and his second in command at the studio. But Woltz \\nregained his senses before they arrived. \\n\\nHe had been profoundly shocked. What kind of man could \\ndestroy an animal worth six hundred thousand dollars? \\nWithout a word of warning. Without any negotiation to have \\nthe act, its order, countermanded. The ruthlessness, the sheer \\ndisregard for any \\\\alue8, implied a man who considered him- \\nself completely his owrt law, even his own God. And a man \\nwho backed up this kind of will with the power and cunning \\nthat held his own stable security force of no account. For by \\nthis time Woltz had learned that the horse’s body had ob- \\nviously been heavily drugged before someone leisurely hacked \\nthe huge triangular head ofiF with an axe. The men on night \\nduty claimed that they had heard nothing. To Woltz this \\nseemed impossible. They could be made to talk. They had \\nbeen bought off and they could be made to tell who had done \\nthe buying. \\n\\nWoltz was not a stupid man, he was merely a supremely \\negotistical one. He had mistaken the power he wielded in his \\nworld to be more potent than the power of Don Corleone. He \\nhad merely need^ some proof that this was not true. He \\nunderstood this message. That despite all his wealth, despite \\nall his contacts with the President of the United States, despite \\nall his claims of friendship with the director of the FBI, an \\nobscure importer of Italian olive oil would have him killed. \\nWould actually have him killed! Because he wouldn’t give \\nJohnny Fontane a movie part he wanted. It was incredible. \\nPeople didn’t have any right to act that way. There couldn’t be \\nany kind of world if people acted that way. It was insane. It \\nmeant you couldn’t do what you wanted with your own \\nmoney, with the companies you owned, the power you had to \\ngive orders. It was ten times worse than communism. It had to \\nbe smashed. It must never be allowed. \\n\\nWoltz let the doctor give him a very mild sedation. It helped \\n\\n69 \\n\\n\\n\\nhim calm down again and to think sensibly. What really \\nshocked him was the casualness with which this man Corleonc \\nhad ordered the destruction of a world-famous horse worth \\nsix hundred thousand dollars. Six hundred thousand dollars I \\nAnd that was just for openers- Woltz shuddered. He thought \\nof this life he had built up. He was rich. He could have the \\nmost beautiful women in the world by crooldng his finger and \\npromising a contract. He w^as received by kings and queens. \\nHe lived a life as perfect as money and power could make it. \\nIt was crazy to risk all this because of a wliim. Maybe he could \\nget to Corleone. What was the legal penalty for killing a race- \\nhorse? He laughed wildly and his doctor and servants watched \\nhim with nervous anxiety. Another thought occurred to him. \\nHe would be the laughingstock of California merely because \\nsomeone had contemptuously defied his power in such \\narrogant fashion. That decided him. That and the thought \\nthat maybe, maybe they wouldn’ kill him. That they had \\nsomething much more clever and painful in reserve. \\n\\nWoltz gave the necessary orders. His personal confidential \\nstaff swung into action. The servants and the doctor were \\nsworn to secrecy on pain of incurring the studio and Woltz’s \\nundying enmity. Word was given to the press that the race- \\nhorse Khartoum had died of an illness contracted during his \\nshipment from England. Orders were given to bury the \\nremains in a secret place on the estate. \\n\\nSix hours later Johnny Fontane received a phone call from \\nthe executive producer of the film telling him to report for \\nwork the following Monday. \\n\\nThat evening, Hagen went to the Don’s house to prepare \\nhim for the important meeting the next day with Virgil \\nSollozzo. The Don had summoned his eldest son to attend, \\nand Sonny Corleonc, his heavy Cupid-shaped face drawn with \\nfatigue, w’as sipping at a glass of water. He must still be hump- \\ning that maid of honour, Hagen thought. Another worry. \\n\\nDon Corleone settled into an armchair puffing his Di Nobili \\ncigar. Hagen kept a box of them in his room. He had tried to \\nget the Don to switch to Havanas but the Don claimed they \\nhurt his throat. \\n\\n\\n70 \\n\\n\\n\\n*Do we know everything necessary for us to know?* the \\nDon asked. \\n\\nHagen opened the folder that held his notes. The notes were \\nin no way incriminating, merely cryptic reminders to make \\nsure he touched on every important detail. ‘S0II0220 is coming \\nto us for help/ Hagen said. ‘He will ask the family to put up at \\nleast a million dollars and to promise some sort of immunity \\nfrom the law. For that we get a piece of the action, nobody \\nknows how much. S0II0Z20 is vouched for by the Tattaglia \\nfamily and they may have a piece of the action. The action is \\nnarcotics. Sollozzo has the contacts in Turkey, where they \\ngrow the poppy. From there he ships to Sicily. No trouble. In \\nSicily he has the plant to process into heroin. He has safety- \\nvalve operations to bring it down to morphine and bring it up \\nto heroin if necessary. But it would seem that the processing \\nplant in Sicily is pfotected in every way. The only hitch is \\nbringing it into this country, and then distribution. Also initial \\ncapital. A million dollars cash doesn\\'t grow on trees.* Hagen \\nsaw Don Corleone grimace. The old man hated unnecessary \\nflourishes in business matters. He went on hastily. \\n\\n‘They call Sollozzo the Turk. Two reasons. He*s spent a lot \\nof time in Turkey and is supposed to have a Turkish wife and \\nkids. Second. He’s supposed to be very quick with the knife, or \\nwas, when he was young. Only in matters of business, though, \\nand with some sort of reasonable complaint. A very compe- \\ntent man and his own boss. He has a record, he’s done two \\nterms in prison, one in Italy, one in the United States, and he’s \\nknown to the authorities as a narcotics man. This could be a \\nplus for us. It means that he’ll never get immunity to testify, \\nsince he’s considered the top and, of course, because of his \\nrecord. Also he has an American wife and three c*hildrcn and \\nbe is a good family man. He’ll stand still for any rap as long as \\nhe knows that they will be well taken care of for living \\nmoney.’ \\n\\nThe Don puffed on his cigar and said, ‘Santino, what do \\nyou think?* \\n\\nHagen knew what Sonny would say. Sonny was chafing at \\nbeing under the Don’s thumb. He wanted a big operation of \\nhis own. Something like this would be perfect. \\n\\n\\n71 \\n\\n\\n\\nSonny took a long slug of Scotch. *Thctc*8 a lot of money \\nin that white powder/ he said. *But it could be dangerous. \\nSome people could wind up in jail for twenty years. I’d say that \\nif we kept out of the operations end, just stuck to protection \\nand financing, it might be a good idea.’ \\n\\nHagen looked at Sonny approvingly. He had played his \\ncards well. He had stuck to the obvious, much the best course \\nfor him. \\n\\nThe Don puffed on his cigar. ‘And you, Tom, what do you \\nthink?’ \\n\\nHagen composed himself to be absolutely honest. He had \\nalready come to the conclusion that the Don would refuse \\nSollozzo’s proposition. But what was worse, Hagen was con- \\nvinced that for one of the few times in his experience, the Don \\nhad not thought things through. He was not looking far \\nenough ahead. \\n\\n‘Go ahead, Tom,’ the Don said encouragingly. ‘Not even a \\nSicilian Consigliori always agrees with the boss.* I\\'hey all \\nlaughed. \\n\\n‘I think you should say yes,’ Hagen said. ‘You know^ all the \\nobvious reasons. But the most important one is this. There is \\nmore money potential in narcotics than in any other business. \\nIf we don’t get into it, somebody else will, maybe the Tattaglia \\nfamily. With the revenue they earn they can amass more and \\nmore police and political power. Their family will become \\nstronger than ours. Eventually they will come after us to take \\naway what wc have. It’s just like countries. If they arm, we \\nhave to arm. If they become stronger economically, they \\nbecome a threat to us. Now we have the gambling and we have \\nthe unions and right now they are the best things to have. But \\nI think narcotics is the coming thing. I think we have to have a \\npiece of that action or we risk everything we have. Not now, \\nbut maybe ten years from now.’ \\n\\nThe Don seemed enormously impressed. He puffed on his \\ncigar and murmured, ‘ITiat’s the most important thing of \\ncourse.’ He sighed and got to his feet. ‘What time do I have to \\nmeet this infidel tomorrow?’ \\n\\nHagen said hopefully, ‘He’ll be here at ten in the morning.’ \\nMaybe the Don would go for it. \\n\\n\\n\\n*1’11 want you both here with me/ the Don said. He rose, \\nstretching, and took his son by the arm. ^Santino, get some \\nsleep tonight, you look like t^ devil himself. Take care of \\nyourself, you won*t be young forever.* \\n\\nSonny, encouraged by this sign of fatherly concern, asked \\nthe question Hagen did not dare to ask. ‘Pop, what*8 your \\nanswer going to be?* \\n\\nDon Corleone smiled. ‘How do I know until I hear the \\npercentages and other details? Besides I have to have time to \\nthink over the advice given here tonight. After all, l*m not a \\nman who does things rashly.* As he went out the doot he said \\ncasually to Hagen, ‘Do you have in your notes that the Turk \\nmade his living from prostitution before the war? As the \\nTattaglia family does now. Write that down before you for- \\nget.* There was just a touch of derision in the Don’s voice and \\nHagen flushed. He had deliberately not mentioned it, legiti- \\nmately so since it really had no be^ing, but he had feared it \\nmight prejudice the Don’s decision. He was notoriously \\nstraitlaced in matters of sex. \\n\\nVirgil ‘the Turk* Sollozzo was a powerfully built, medium- \\nsized man of dark complexion who could have been taken for \\na true Turk. He had a scimitar of a nose and cruel black eyes. \\nHe also had an impressive dignity. \\n\\nSonny Corleone met him at the door and brought him into \\nthe oflice where Hagen and the Don waited. Hagen thought he \\nhad never seen a more dangerous-looking man except for \\nLuca Brasi. \\n\\nThere were polite handshakings all around. If the Don ever \\nasks me if this mao has balls, 1 would have to answer yes, \\nHagen thought. He had never seen such force in ohe man, not \\neven the Don. In fset the Don appeared at his worst. He was \\nbeing a little too simple, a little too peasantlike in his greeting. \\n\\nSollozzo came to the point immediately. The business was \\nnarcotics. Everything was set up. Certain poppy fields in \\nTurkey had pledged him certain amounts every year. He had a \\nprof&ected plant in France to convert into morphine. He had an \\nabsolutely secure plant in Sicily to process into heroin. \\nSmuggling into hcih countries was as positively safe as such \\n\\n\\n75 \\n\\n\\n\\nmatters could be. Entry into the United States would entail \\nabout five per cent losses since the FBI itself was incorruptible, \\nas they both knew. But the profits would be enormous, the \\nrisk nonexistent. \\n\\n*Then why do you come to me?’ the Don asked politely. \\n*How have I deserved your generosity?’ \\n\\nSollozzo’s dark face remained impassive. ‘I need two \\nmillion dollars cash,’ he said. ‘Equally important, I need a man \\nwho has powerful friends in the important places. Some of my \\ncouriers will be caught over the years. That is jncviiable. They \\nwill all have clean records, that I promise. So it will be logical \\nfor judges to give light sentences. 1 need a friend w^ho can \\nguarantee that when my people get in trouble they won’t \\nspend more than, a year or two in jail. Then thev won’t talk. \\nBut if they get ten and twenty \\\\ cars, ^ho know In this wc rid \\nthere are many weak individuals. They may talk, they may \\njeopardize more important people. I ega) protection is a must. \\nI hear, Don Corleonc, tho. voa have as many judges in your \\npocket as a bootblack has {ULces of silver.’ \\n\\nDon Corlcone didn’t bother U > acknowledge the compliment. \\n‘What percentage for my family?’ he asked. \\n\\nSoDoz/o’s eyes gleamed. ‘Fifty per cent.’ He paused and \\nthen said in a voice t!ut was almost a caress, ‘In the first year \\nyour share would be three or four million dollars. Then it \\nwould go up.’ \\n\\nDon (\"orleone said, ‘And what is the percentage of the \\nTatiagha family?’ \\n\\nFor the first linic Sollozzo seemed to be nervous. ‘They will \\nreceive soriicthing from my share. I need some help in the \\noperations.\\' \\n\\n‘ So,’ Don Corleonc said, ‘I receive fifty per cent merely for \\nfinance and legal protection. I have no worries about opera- \\ntions, is that what you tell me?’ \\n\\nSollozzo nodded. ‘If you think two million dollars in cash is \\n“merely finance”, I congratulate you, Don Corleone.’ \\n\\nThe Don said quietly, ‘I consented to see you out of my \\nrespect for the Tattaglias and because I’ve heard you arc a \\nserious man to be treated also with respect. I must say no to \\nyou but I must give you my reasons. The profits in your \\n\\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\n\\nbusiness are huge but so are the risks. Your operation, if 1 were \\npart of it, could damage my other interests. It’s true I have \\nmany, many friends in politics, but they would not be so ’ \\nfriendly if my business were narcotics instead of gambling. \\nThey think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless \\nvice, and they think narcotics a dirty business. No, don’t \\nprotest. I’m telling you their thoughts, not mine. How a man \\nmakes his living is not my concern. And what I am telling you \\nis that this business of yours is too risky. All the members of \\nmy family have lived well the last ten years, without danger, \\nwithout harm, I can’t endanger them or their livelihoods out \\nof greed.’ \\n\\nThe only sign of Soilozzo’s disappointment was a quick \\nflickering of his eyes around the room, as if he hoped Hagen \\nor Sonny would speak in his support. Then he said, ‘Are you \\nworried about security for your two million?’ \\n\\nThe Don smiled coldly. ‘No,* he said. \\n\\nS0II0220 tried again. ‘The Tattaglia family will guarantee \\nyour investment also.’ \\n\\nIt was then tluit Sonny Corleone made an unforgivable error \\nin judgement and procedure. He said eagerly, ‘The Tattaglia \\nfamily guarantees the return of our investment without any \\npercentage from us?’ \\n\\nHagen was horrified at this break. He saw the Don turn \\ncold, malevolent eyes on his eldest son, who froze in uncom- \\nprehending dismay. Sollozzo’s eyes flickered again but this \\ntime with satisfaction. He had discovered a chink in the Don’s \\nfortress. When the Don spoke his voice held a dismissal. \\n‘Young people arc greedy,* he said. ‘And today they have no \\nmanners. They interrupt their ciders. They meddle. But I have \\na sentimental weakness for my children and I have spoiled \\nthem. As you see. Signor S0II0220, my no is final. Let me say \\nthat I myself wish you good fortune in your business. It has no \\nconflict with my own. I’m sorry that I had to disappoint you.’ \\n\\nSollozzo bowed, shook the Don’s hand and let Hagen take \\nhim to his car outside. There was no expression on his face \\nwhen he said goodbye to Hagen. \\n\\nBack in the room, Don Corleone asked Hagen, ‘What did \\nyou think of that man?’ \\n\\n\\n75 \\n\\n\\n\\n^He’s a Sicilian,’ Hagen said dryly. \\n\\nThe Don nodded his head thoughtfully. Then he turned to \\nhis son and said gently, * Sahtino, never let anyone outside the \\nfamily know what you are thinking. Never let them know \\nwhat you have under your Bngernails. I think your brain is \\ngoing soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl. \\nStop it and pay attention to business. Now get out of my \\nsight.* \\n\\nHagen saw the surprise on Sonny’s face, then anger at his \\nCither’s reproach. Did he really think the Don would be \\nignorant of his conquest, Hagen wondered. And did he really \\nnot know what a dangerous mistake he had made this morn- \\ning? If that were true, Hagen would never wish to be the \\nConsigliori to the Don of Santino Corleone. \\n\\nDon Corleone waited until Sonny had left the room. Then \\nhe sank back into his leather armchair and motioned brus- \\nquely for a drink. Hagen poured him a glass of anisette. The \\nDon looked up at him. ‘ Send Luca Brasi to see me,’ he said. \\n\\nThree months later, Hagen hurried through the paper work \\nin his city office hoping to leave early enough for some Christ- \\nmas shopping for his wife and children. He was interrupted by \\na phone call from a Johnny Fontane bubbling wi^ high \\nspirits. The picture had been shot, the rushes, whatever the \\nhell they were, Hagen thought, were fabulous. He was sending \\nthe Don a present for Christmas that would knock his eyes \\nout, he’d bring it himself but there were some little things to \\nbe done in the movie. He would have to stay out on the Coast. \\nHagen tried to conceal his impatience. Johnny Fontane’s \\ncharm had always been lost on him. But his interest was \\naroused. ‘What is it?’ he asked. Johnny Fontane chuckled and \\nsaid, ‘I can’t tell, that’s the best part of a Christmas present.’ \\nHagen immediately lost all interest and finally managed, \\npolitely, to hang up. \\n\\nTen minutes later his secretary told hi^n that Connie \\nCorleone Was on the phone and wanted to\\'^ speak to him. \\nHagen sighed. As a young girl Connie had b^n nice, as a \\nmarried woman she was a nuisance. She made complaints \\nabout her husband. She kept going home to visit her mother \\n\\n76 \\n\\n\\n\\nfor two or three days. AodGurloRliadwas tatningoattobea \\nreal loser. He had ^en fixed up with a nice little business and \\nwas running it into the ground. He was also drinking, whoring \\naround, gambling, and beating his wife up occasionally. \\nConnie hadn’t told her family about that but she had told \\nHagen. He wondered what new tale of woe she had for him \\nnow. \\n\\nBut the Christmas spirit seemed to have cheered her up. She \\njust wanted to ask Hagen what her father would really like for \\nChristmas. And Sonny and Fred and Mike. She already knew \\nwhat she would get her mother. Hagen made some sugges- \\ntions, all of which she rejected as silly. Finally she let him go. \\n\\nWhen the phone rang again, Hagen threw his papers back \\ninto the basket. The hell with it. He’d leave. It never occurred \\nto him to refuse to take the call, however. When his secretary \\ntold nim it was Michael Corleone he picked up the phone with \\npleasure. He had always liked Mike. \\n\\n*Tom,* Michael Corleone said, ‘I’m driving down to the \\ncity with Kay tomorrow. There’s something important I want \\nto tell the old man before Christmas. Will he be home to- \\nmorrow night?’ \\n\\n^Surc,’ Hagen said. \\'He’s not going out of town until after \\nChristmas. Anything 1 can do for you?’ \\n\\nMichael was as closemouthed as his father. \\'No,’ he said. *1 \\nguess rU see you Christmas, everybody is going to be out at \\nLong Beach, right?’ \\n\\n\\'Right,’ Hagen said. He was amused when Mike hung up on \\nhim without any small talk. \\n\\nHe told his secretary to call his wife and tell her he would be \\nhome a little late but to have some supper for him.* Outside the \\nbuilding he walked briskly downtown towards Macy’s. Some- \\none stepped in his way. To his surprise he saw it was SoUozao. \\n\\nSoUozzo took him by the arm and said quietly, ‘Don’t be \\nfrightened, I just want to talk to you.’ A car parked at the \\nkerb suddenly had its door open. Sollozzo said urgently, ‘Get \\nm, I want to talk to you.’ \\n\\nHagen pulled his arm loose. He was sdil not alarmed, just \\nirritated. ‘1 haven’t got time,’ he said. At that moment two \\nmen came up behind him. Hagen felt a sudden weakness in his \\n\\n\\n77 \\n\\n\\n\\nkgs. S0II0220 said softly, ‘Get in the car. If I wanted to kill \\nyou you’d be dead now. Trust me.’ \\n\\nWithout a shred of trust Hagen got into the car. \\n\\nMichael Corleone had lied to Hagen. He was already in New \\nYork, and he had called from a room in the Hotel Pennsylvania \\nless than ten blocks away. Wl^.cn he hung up the phone, Kay \\nAdams put out her cigarette and said, ‘Mike, what a good \\nfibber you are.* \\n\\nMichael sat down beside her on the bed. ‘All for you, \\nhoney ; if I told my family wc were in town we*d have to go \\nthere right away. Then we couldn’t go out to dinner, we \\ncouldn’t go to the theatre, and we couldn’t sleep together \\ntonight. Not in my father’s house, not when we’re not \\nmarried.* He put his arms around her and kissed her gently on \\nthe lips. Her mouth was sweet and he gently pulled her down \\non the bed. She closed her eyes, waiting for him to make love \\nto her and Michael felt an enormous happiness. He had spent \\nthe war years fighting in the Pacific, and on those bloody \\nislands he had dreamed of a girl like Kay Adams. Of a beauty \\nlike hers, A fair and fragile body, milky-skinned and electri- \\nfied by passion. She opened her eyes and then pulled his head \\ndown to kiss him. They made love until it was time for dinner \\nand the theatre. \\n\\nAfter dinner they walked past the brightly-lit department \\nstores full of holiday shoppers and Michael said to her, ‘What \\nshall 1 get you for Christmas?’ \\n\\nShe pressed against him. ‘Just you,’ she said. ‘Do you think \\nyour father will approve of me?’ \\n\\nMichael said gently, ‘That’s not really the question. Will \\nyour parents approve of me?’ \\n\\nKay shrugged. ‘I don’t care,’ she said. \\n\\nMichael said, ‘1 even thought of changing my name, \\nlegally, but if something happened, that wouldn’t really help. \\nYou sure you want to be a Corleone?’ He said it only half- \\njokingly. \\n\\n‘Yes,’ she said without smiling. They pressed against each \\nother. They had decided to get married during Christmas \\nweek, a quiet civil ceremony at City Hall with just two friends \\n\\n78 \\n\\n\\n\\nas witnesses. But Michael had insisted he must tell his father. \\nHe had explained that his father would not object in any way \\nas long as it was not done in secrecy. Kay was doubtful. She \\nsaid she could not tell her parents until after the marriage. *Of \\ncourse they’ll think I’m pregnant,’ she said. Michael grinned. \\n\\n* So will my parents,’ he said. \\n\\nWhat neither of them mentioned was the fact that Michael \\nwould have to cut his close ties with his family. They both \\nunderstood that Michael had already done so to some extent \\nand yet they both felt guilty about this fact. Tliey planned to \\nfinish college, seeing each other weekends and living together \\nduring summer vacations. It seemed like a happy life. \\n\\nThe play was a musical called Carousel and its sentimental \\nstory of a braggart thief made them smile at each other with \\namusement. When they came out of the theatre it had turned \\ncold. Kay snuggled up to him and said, ‘After we’re married, \\nwill you beat me and then steal a star for a present?’ \\n\\nMichael laughed. ‘I’m going to be a mathematics professor,’ \\nhe said. Then he asked, ‘Do you want something to eat before \\nwe go to the hotel?’ \\n\\nliy shook her head. She looked up at him meaningfully. As \\nalways he was touched by her eagerness to make love. He \\nsmiled down at her, and they kissed in the cold street. Michael \\nfelt hungry, and he decided to order sandwiches sent up to the \\nroom. \\n\\nIn the hotel lobby Michael pushed Kay towards the news- \\nstand and said, ‘Get the papers while I get the key.’ He had to \\nwait in a small line; the hotel was still short of help despite the \\nend of the war. Michael got his room key and looked around \\nimpatiently for Kay. She was standing by the \\'news-stand, \\nstaring down at a newspaper she held in her hand. He walked \\ntowards her. She looked up at him. Her eyes were filled with \\ntears. ‘Oh, Mike,’ she said, ‘oh, Mike.’ He took the paper \\nfrom her hands. The first thing he saw was a photo of his \\nfather lying in the street, his head in a pool of blood. A man \\nwas sitting on the kerb weeping like a child. It was his \\nbrother Freddie. Michael Corleone felt his body turning to \\nice. There was no grief, no fear, just cold rage. He said to Kay, \\n‘Go up to the room.’ But he had to take her by the arm and \\n\\n\\n79 \\n\\n\\n\\nlead her into the elevator. They rode up together in silence. In \\ntheir room^ Michael sat down on the bed and opened the \\npaper. The headlines said, vito corleoke shot, alleged \\n\\nRACKET CHIEF CRITICALLY WOUNDED. OPERATED ON \\nUNDER HEAVY POLICE GUARD. BLOODY MOB WAR \\nFEARED. \\n\\nMichael felt the weakness in his legs. He said to Kay, ‘He’s \\nnot dead, the bastards didn’t kill him.’ He read the story again. \\nHis father had been shot at five in the afternoon. That meant \\nthat while he had been making love to Kay, having dinner, \\nenjoying the theatre, his father was near death. Michael felt \\nsick with guilt. \\n\\nKay said, ‘Shall v/e go down to the hospital now?’ \\n\\nMichael shook his head. ‘Let me call the house first. The \\npeople who cid this are cra 2 y and now that the old man’s still \\nalive they’ll be desperate. Who the hell knows what thcy’U \\npull next.’ \\n\\nBoth phones in the Long Beach house were busy and it was \\nalmost twenty minutes before Michael could get through. He \\nheard Sonny’s voice saying, ‘Yeah.’ \\n\\n‘ Sonny, it’s me,’ Michael said. \\n\\nHe could hear the relief in Sonny’s voice. ‘Jesus, kid, you \\nhad us worried. VCT?ere the hell are you? T’vc sent people to \\nthat hick town of yours to see what happened .’ \\n\\n‘How’s the old man?’ Michael said. ‘How bad is he hurt?’ \\n\\n‘Pretty bad,’ Sonny said. ‘They shot him five times. But he’s \\ntough.’ Sonny’s voice was proud. ‘The doctors said he’ll pull \\nthrough. Listen, kid, I’m busy, I can’t talk, where are you?’ \\n\\n‘In New York,’ Michael said. ‘Didn’t Tom tell you I was \\ncoming down?’ \\n\\nSonny’s voice dropped a little. ‘They’ve snatched Tom. \\nThat’s why I was worried about you. His wife is here. She \\ndon’t know and neither do the cops. I don’t want them to \\nknow. The bastards who pulled this must he crazy. I want you \\nto get out here right away and keep your mouth shut. OK?’ \\n\\n‘OK,’ Mike said, ‘do you know who did it?’ \\n\\n‘Sure,’ Sonny said. ‘And as soon as Luca Brasi checks in \\nthey’re gonna he dead meat. We still have all the horses.* \\n\\n‘I’ll be out in an hour/ Mike said. ‘In a cab/ He hung up. \\n\\n8o \\n\\n\\n\\nThe papers had been oa the streets {be over three hoars. There \\nmust have been radio news reports. It was almost impossible \\nthat Luca hadn’t heard the news. Thoughtfully Michael \\npondered the question. Where was Luca Brasi? It was the \\nsame question ^t Hagen was asking himself at that moment. \\nIt was the same question that was worrying Sonny Codeone \\nout in Long Beach. \\n\\nAt a quarter to five that afternoon, Don Corleone had \\nfinished checking the papers the office manager of his olive oil \\ncompany had prepared for him. He put on his jacket and \\nrapp^ his knuckles on his son Freddie’s head to make him \\ntake his nose out of the afternoon newspaper. *Tell Gatto to \\nget the car from the lot/ he said. *ril be ready to go home in a \\nfew minutes.’ \\n\\nFreddie grunted. ’I’ll have to get it myself. Paulie called in \\nsick this morning. Got a cold again.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone looked thoughtful for a moment. ’That’s Ae \\nthird time this month. I think maybe you’d better get a \\nhealthier fellow for this job. Tell Tom.’ \\n\\nFred protested. ’PauUe’s a good kid. If he says he’s sick, he’s \\nsick. I don’t mind getting the car.’ He left the office. Don \\nCorleone watched out the window as his son crossed Ninth \\nAvenue to the parking lot. He stopped to call Hagen’s office \\nbut there was no answer. He called the house at Long Beach \\nbut again there was no answer. Irritsted, he looked out the \\nwindow. His car was parked at the kerb in front of bis build- \\ning. Freddie was leaning against the fender, arms folded, \\nwatching the throng of Christmas shoppers. Don Corleone \\nput on his jacket. The office manager helped him with his \\novercoat. Don Corleone grunted his thanks and went out the \\ndoor and started down the two flights of steps. \\n\\nOut in the street the early winter light was Bdling. Freddie \\nleaned casuaUy against the fmder of the heavy Buick. When he \\nsaw his father come out of the building Freddie went out Into \\nthe street to the driver’s side of the car and got in. Don \\nCorleone was about to get in on the sidewalk side of the car \\nwhen he hesitated and then turned back to the long open fhiit \\nstand near the comer, lliis had been Us habit latcfy, he loved \\n\\nit \\n\\n\\n\\nthe big out-of-season fruits, yellow peaches and oranges, that \\nglowed in their green boxes. The proprietor sprang to serve \\nhim. Don Corleone did not handle the fruit. He pointed. The \\nfruit man disputed his decisions only once, to show him that \\none of his choices had a rotten underside. Don Corleone took \\nthe paper bag in his left hand and paid the man with a five- \\ndollar bill. He took his change and, as he turned to go back to \\nthe waiting car, two men stepped from around the corner. \\nDon Corleone knew immediately what was to happen. \\n\\nThe two men wore black overcoats and black hats pulled \\nlow to prevent identification by witnesses. They had not \\nexpected Don Corleone’s alert reaction. He dropped the bag of \\nfruit and darted towards the parked car with startling quickness \\nfor a man of his bulk. At the same time he shouted, ‘ Fredo, \\nFredo. * It was only then that the two men drew their guns and \\nfired. \\n\\nThe first bullet caught Don Corleone in the back. He felt the \\nhammer shock of its impact but made his body move towards \\nthe car. The next two bullets hit him in the buttocks and sent \\nhim sprawling in the middle of the street. Meanwhile the two \\ngunmen, careful not to slip on the roiling fruit, staited to \\nfollow in order to finish him off. At that moment, perhaps no \\nmore than five seconds after the Don’s call to his son, Frede- \\nrico Corleone appeared out of his car, looming over it. The \\ngunmen fired two more hasty shots at the Don lying in the \\ngutter. One hit him in the fleshy part of his arm and the second \\nhit him in the calf of his right leg. Though these wounds were \\nthe least serious they bled profusely, forming small pools of \\nblood beside his body- But by this time Don Corleone had lost \\nconsciousness. \\n\\nFreddie had heard his father shout, calling him by his child- \\nhood name, and then he had heard the first two loud reports. \\nBy the time he got out of the car he was in shock, he had not \\neven drawn his gun. The tw^o assassins could easily have shot \\nhim down. But they too panicked. They must have known the \\nson was armed, and besides too much time had passed. They \\ndisappeared around the corner, leaving Freddie alone in the \\nstreet with his father’s bleeding body. Many of the people \\nthronging the avenue had flung themselves into doorways \\n\\n\\n\\nor on the ground, others had huddled together in small \\ngroups, \\n\\nFr^dic still had not drawn his weapon. He seemed stunned. \\nHe stared down at his father’s body lying face down on the \\ntarred street, lying now in what seemed to him a blackish lake \\nof blood. Freddie went into physical shock. People eddied out \\nagain and someone, seeing him start to sag, led him to the \\nkerbstone and made him sit down on it. A crowd gathered \\naround Don Corleone’s body, a circle that shattered when the \\nfirst police car sirened a path through them. Directly behind \\nthe police was the Daily News radio car and even before it \\nstopped a photographer jumped out to snap pictures of the \\nbleeding Don Corleone. A few moments later an ambulance \\narrived. Tlic photographer turned his attention to Freddie \\nCorleone, who was now weeping openly, and this was a \\ncuriously comical sight, because of his tough, Cupid-fcatured \\nface, heavy nose and thick mouth smeared with snot. Detec- \\ntives were spreading through the crowd and more police cars \\nwere coming up. One detective knelt beside Freddie, ques- \\ntioning him, but Freddie was too deep in shock to answer. The \\ndetective reached inside Freddie’s coat and lifted his wallet. \\nHe looked at the identification inside and whistled to his \\npartner. In just a few seconds Freddie had been cut o£f from \\nthe crowd by a flock of plainclothesmcn. The first detective \\nfound Freddie’s gun in its shoulder holster and took it. Then \\nthey lifted Freddie oflF his feet and shoved him into an un- \\nmarked car. A.S that car pulled away it was followed by the \\nDalfy News radio car. The photographer was still snapping \\npictures of everybody and everything. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIn the half hour after the shooting of his father. Sonny \\nCorleone received five phone calls in rapid succession. The \\nfirst was from Detective John Phillips, who was on the family \\npayroll and had been in the lead car- of plainclothesmcn at the \\nscene of the shooting. The first thing he said to Sonny over the \\nphone was, ‘Do you recognize my voice?\\' \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Sonny said. He was fresh from a nap, called to the \\nphone by his wife. \\n\\nPhillips said quickly without preamble, ‘Somebody shot \\n\\n85 \\n\\n\\n\\nyour fiithet outside his pkoe. Fifteen minutes ago. He*s alive \\nbut hwt bad. They’ve n^en him to Fiench Hospital. They got \\nyour brother Freddie down at the Chelsea precdnct. You better \\nget him a doctor when they turn him loose. I’m going down to \\nthe hospital now to help question your old man» if he can talk. \\nI’ll keep you posted.’ . \\n\\nAcross the table, Sonny’s wife Sandra noticed that her \\nhusband’s face had gone red with flushing blood. His eyes \\nwere glazed over. She whispered, ^What’s the matter?’ He \\nwaved at her impatiently to shut up, swung his body away so \\nthat his back was towards her and said into the phone, * You \\nsure he’s alive?’ \\n\\n* Yeah, I’m sure,* the detective said. ‘A lot of blood but I \\nthink maybe he’s not as bad as he looks.* \\n\\n‘Thanka,’ Sonny said. ‘Be home tomorrow morning eight \\nsharp. You got a grand coming.’ \\n\\nSonny cradled the phone. He forced himself to sit sdll. He \\nknew that his greatest weakness was his anger and this was one \\ntime when anger could be fatal. The first thing to do was get \\nTom Hagen. But before he could pick up the phone, it rang. \\nThe call was from the bookmaker licensed by the Family to \\noperate in the district of the Don’s office. The bookmaker had \\ncalled to tell him that the Don had been kiUed, shot dead in the \\nstreet. After a few questions to make sure that the bookmaker’s \\ninformant had not been dose to the body. Sonny dismissed the \\ninformation as incorrect. Phillips’ dope would be more \\naccurate. The phone rang almost immediately a third time. It \\nwas a reporter from the Daily News. As soon as he identified \\nhimself. Sonny Corleone hung up. \\n\\nHe dialled Hagen’s house and asked Hagen’s wife, ‘Did \\nTom come home yet?’ She said, ‘No,’ that he was not due for \\nanother twenty minutes but she expected him home for \\nsupper. ‘Have him call me,’ Sonny said. \\n\\nHe tried to think things out. He tried to imagine how his \\nfather would react in a like situation. He had ^own imme- \\ndiately that this was an attack by SoUozzo, but Sollozzo would \\nnever have dared to eliminate so high-ranking a leader as the \\nDon unless he was backed by other powerful people. The \\nphone, ringing for the fourth dme, interrupted his droughts. \\n\\n84 \\n\\n\\n\\nTlie Toke oo the ocher end w«s very soft, very gende. \\n^Sendno Codeone?* it tsked. \\n\\n*Yeah/ Sonny stuL \\n\\n* We have Tom Hagen/ the yolce said. \\'In about three hours \\nhe*U be released with our proposidon. Don\\'t do anything rash \\nuntil you\\'ve heard what he has to say. You can only cause a lot \\nof trouble. What\\'s done is done. Everybody has to be sensible \\nnow. Don\\'t lose that famous temper yours.\\' The voice was \\nslightly mocking. Sonny couldn\\'t be sure, but it sounded like \\nSollozzo. He made his voice sound muted, depressed. \\'I’U \\nwait/ he said. He heard the receiver on the other end dick. \\nHe k>oked at his heavy gold-banded wristwatch and noted \\nthe exact time of the call and jotted it down on the table- \\ndoth. \\n\\nHe sat at the kitch^ table, frowning. His wife asked, \\n*Sonny, what is it?\\' He told her calmly. \\'They shot the old \\nman.\\' ^en he saw the shock on her face he said roughly, \\n\\'Don\\'t worry, he’s not dead. And nothing else is going to \\nhappen.\\' He ^d not tell her about Hagen, ^d then the phone \\nrang for the fifth time. \\n\\nIt was Qemenza. The fat man\\'s voice came wheeaing over \\nthe phone in gruntlike gasps. \\'You hear about your father?\\' \\nhe asked. \\n\\n\\'Yeah,* Sonny said. \\'But he’s not dead,’ There was a long \\npause over the phone and then Clemenxa\\'s voice came packed \\nwith emotion, \\'Thank God, thank God.\\' Then anxiously, \\n\\'You sure? I got word he was dead in the street.\\' \\n\\n\\'He’s alive,’ Sonny said. He was listening intently to every \\nintonation in Qemenza’s voice. The emotion had seemed \\ngenuine but it was part of the fat man\\'s profession to be a good \\nactor. \\n\\n\\'You\\'D have to carry the baD, Sonny,\\' Qemenza said. \\'What \\ndo you want me to do?\\' \\n\\n\\'Get over to my father\\'s house,’ Sonny said. \\'Bring Paulie \\nGatto.\\' \\n\\n\\'That\\'s aU?’ Gemenza asked. \\'Don\\'t you want me to send \\nsome people to the hospital and your place?\\' \\n\\n\\'No, 1 just want you and Paulie Gatto,\\' Sonny said. There \\nwas a long pause. Qemenza was getting the message. To make \\n\\n\\n\\nit a little more natural. Sonny asked, ‘Where the hell was \\nPaulie anyway? What the hell was he doing?’ \\n\\nThere was no longer any wheezing on the other end of the \\nline. Clemcnza’s voice was guarded. ‘ Paulie was sick, he had a \\ncold, so he stayed home. He’s been a little sick all winter,’ \\n\\nSonny was instantly alert. ‘How many times did he stay \\nhome the last couple of months?’ \\n\\n‘Maybe three or four times,’ Clemenza said. ‘I always asked \\nFreddie if he wanted another guy but he said no. There’s \\nbeen no cause, the last ten years things been smooth, you \\nknow.’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Sonny said. ‘I’ll see you at my father’s house. Be \\nsure you bring Paulie. Pick him up on your way over. I don’t \\ncare how sick he is. You got that?’ He slammed down the \\nphone without waiting for an answer. \\n\\nHis wife was weeping silently. He stared at her for a \\nmoment, then said in a harsh voice, ‘Any of our people call, \\ntell them to get me in my father’s house on his special phone. \\nAnybody else call, you don’t know nothing. If Tom’s wife \\ncalls, tell her that Tom won’t be home for a while, he’s on \\nbusiness.’ \\n\\nHe pondered for a moment. ‘A couple of our people will \\ncome to stay here.’ He saw her look of fright and said im- \\npatiently, ‘You don’t have to be scared, I just want them \\nhere. Do whatever they tell you to do. If you wanta talk to me, \\nget me on Pop’s special phone but don’t call me unless \\nit’s really important. And don’t worry.’ He went out of the \\nhouse. \\n\\nDarkness had fallen and the December wind whipped \\nthrough the mall. Sonny had no fear about stepping out into \\nthe riight. All eight houses were owned by Don Corleone. At \\nthe mouth of the mall the two houses on either side vrere \\nrented by family retainers with their own families and star \\nboarders, single men who lived in the basement apartments. \\nOf the remaining six houses that formed the rest of the half \\ncircle, one was inhabited by Tom Hagen and his family, his \\nown, and the smallest and least ostentatious by the Don him- \\nself. The other three houses were given rent-free to retired \\nfriends of the Don with the understanding that they would be \\n\\n86 \\n\\n\\n\\nvacated whenever he requested. The harmless-looking mall \\nwas an impregnable fortress. \\n\\nAll eight houses were equipped with floodlights which \\nbathed the grounds around them and made the mall impossible \\nto lurk in. Sonny went acrc;ss tiic street to his father’s house \\nand let himself inside with his own key. He yelled out, ‘Ma, \\nwhcie are you?’ and his mother came out of the kitchen. \\nBehind her rose the smell of frying peppers. Before she could \\nsay an3\\'\\'thing. Sonny took her by the arm and made her sit \\ndown. ‘I just got a call,’ he said. ‘Now don’t get worried. \\nPop\\'s in the hospital, he’s iiurt. Get dressed and get ready to \\nget down there. I’ll have a car and a driver for you in a little \\nwhile. OK?’ \\n\\nHis mother looked at him steadily for a moment and then \\nasked in Italian, ‘Have they shot him?’ \\n\\nScjnny nodded. His mother bowed her head for a moment. \\nI\\'hea she went back into the kitchen. Sonny followed her. He \\nwatched her turn off the gas under the panful of peppers and \\nthen go out and up to the bedroom. He took peppers from the \\npan and bread from the basket on the table and made a sloppy \\nsand wichv^ with hot olive oil dripping from his fingers. He \\nwent into the huge corner room that wai, his father’s office and \\ntook the special phone from a locked cabinet box. The phone \\nhad been especially installed and was listed under a phony \\nname and a phony address. The first person he called was Luca \\nBrasi. There was no answer. Then he called the safety-valve \\ncaporegime in Brooklyn, a man of unquestioned loyalty to the \\nDon. This man’s name was Tessio. Sonny told him what had \\nhappened and what he wanted. Tessio was to recruit fifty \\nabsolutely reliable men. He was to send guards to the hospital, \\nhe was to send men out to Long Beach to work there. Tessio \\nasked, ‘Did they get Clemenza too?’ Sonny said, ‘I don’t want \\nto use Clemcnza’s people right now.’ Tessio understood im- \\nmediately, there was a pause, and then he said, ‘Excuse me. \\nSonny, I say this as your father would say it. Don’t move too \\nfast. I can’t believe Clemenza would betray us.* \\n\\n‘Thanks,’ Sonny said. ‘I don’t think so but 1 have to be \\ncareful. Right?’ \\n\\n‘Right,’ Tessio said. \\n\\n\\n87 \\n\\n\\n\\n^Another thing/ Sonny said. *My kid brother Mike goes to \\ncollege in Hanover, New Hampshire. Get some people we \\nknow in Boston to go up and get him and bring him down \\nhere to the house un^ this blows over. I’ll call him up so he’ll \\nexpect them. Again I’m just playing the percentages, just to \\nmake sure.’ \\n\\n^OK/ Tessio said, ‘I’ll be over your father’s house as soon \\nas I get things rolling. OK? You Imow my boys, right?’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Sonny said. He hung up. He went over to a small \\nwall safe and unlocked it. From it he took an indexed book \\nbound in blue leather. He opened it to the T’s until he found \\nthe entry he was looking for. It read, ‘Ray Farrell $5,000 \\nChristmas Eve.’ This was followed by a telephone number. \\nSonny dialled the number and said, ‘Farrell?’ The man on the \\nother end answered, ‘Yes.’ Sonny said, ‘This is Santino \\nCorleone. I want you to do me a favour and I want you to do \\nit right away. I want you to check two phone numbers and \\ngive me all the calls they got and all the calls they made for the \\nlast three months.’ He gave Farrell the number of Paulie \\nGatto’s home and Gemenza’s home. Then he said, ‘This is \\nimportant. Get it to me before midnight and you’ll have an \\nextra very Merry Christmas.’ \\n\\nBefore he settled back to think things out he gave Luca \\nBrasi’s number one more call. Again there was no answer. \\nThis worried him but he put it out of his mind. Luca would \\ncome to the house as soon as he heard the news. Sonny leaned \\nback in the swivel chair. In an hour the house would be \\nswarming with Family people and he would have to tell them \\nall what to do, and now t^t he finally had time to think he \\nrealized how serious the situation was. It was the first challenge \\nto the Corleone Family and their power in ten years. There was \\nno doubt that SoUozzo was behind it, but he would never have \\ndared attempt such a stroke unless he had support from at least \\none of the five great New York fiunilies. And that support \\nmust have come from the Tattaglias. Which meant a full-scale \\nwar or an unmediate settlement on SoUozzo’s terms. Sonny \\nsmiled grimly. The wily Turk had planned well but he had \\nbeen unlucky. The old man was alive and so it was war. With \\nLuca Brasi and the resources of the Co d eonc Family there \\n\\n\\n88 \\n\\n\\n\\ncould be but one outcome. But again the nagging woiry. \\nWhere was Luca Biasi? \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE \\n\\n\\nCounting the driver, there were four men in the car with \\nHagen. They put him in the back seat, in the middle of the two \\nmen who had come up behind him in the street. Solloazo sat \\nup front. The man on Hagen’s right reached over across his \\nbody and tilted Hagen’s hat over his eyes so that he could not \\nsec. ‘Don’t even move your pinkie,’ he said. \\n\\nIt was a short ride, not more than twenty minutes and when \\nthey got out of the*car Hagen could not recognize the neigh- \\nbourhood because darkness had fallen. They led him into a \\nbasement apartment and made him sit on a straight-backed \\nkitchen chair. Sollozzo sat across the kitchen table from him. \\nHis dark face had a peculiarly vulterine look. \\n\\n‘I don’t want you to be afraid,’ he said. ‘I know you’re not \\nin the muscle end of the Family. I want you to help the \\nCorleones and 1 want you to help me.’ \\n\\nHagen’s hands were shaking as he put a cigarette in his \\nmouth. One of the men brought a bottle of rye to the table and \\ngave him a slug of it in a china coffee cup. Hagen drank the \\nfiery liquid gratefully. It steadied his h^ds and took the \\nweakness out of his legs. \\n\\n‘Your boss is dead,’ SoUozzo said. He paused, surprised at \\nthe tears that sprang to Hagen’s eyes. Then he went on. ‘ We \\ngot him outside his office, in the street. As soon jis I got the \\nword, I picked you up. You have to make the peace between \\nme and Sonny.’ \\n\\nHagen didn’t answer. He was surprised at his own grief. \\nAnd the feeling of desolation mixed with his fear of \\ndeath. S0II0220 was speaking again. ‘ Sonny was hot for my deal. \\nRight? You know it’s the smart thing to do too. Narcotics is \\nthe coming thing. There’s so much money in it that everybody \\ncan get rich just in a couple of years. The Don was an old \\n\\n$9 \\n\\n\\n\\n“Moustache Pete’\\\\ his day was over but he didn’t know it. \\nNow he’s dead, nothing can bring him back. I’m ready to \\nmake a new deal, I want you to talk Sonny into taking it.’ \\n\\nMagen said, ‘You haven’t got a chance. Sonny will come \\nafter you with everything he’s got.’ \\n\\nSollozzo said impatiently, ‘That’s gonna be his first reaction. \\nYou have to talk some sense to him. The Tattaglia Family \\nstand behind me with all their people. The other New York \\nFamilies will go along with anything that will stop a full-scale \\nwar between us. Our war has to hurt them and their businesses. \\nIf Sonny goes along with the deal, the other Families in the \\ncountry will consider it none of their afiair, even the Don’s \\noldest friends.* \\n\\nHagen stared down at his hands, not answering. Sollozzo \\nwent on persuasively, ‘ The Don was slipping. In the old days \\nI could never have^ot to him. The other Families distrust him \\nbecause he made you his Consigiiori and you’re not even Italian, \\nmuch less Sicilian. If it goes to all-out war the Corleone Family \\nwill be smashed and everybody loses, me included. I need the \\nFamily political contacts more than I need the money even. So \\ntalk to Sonny, talk to the caporegimes\\\\ you’ll save a lot of blood- \\nshed.’ \\n\\nHagen held out his china cup for more whisky. ‘I’ll try,’ he \\nsaid. ‘But Sonny is strong-headed. And even Sonny won’t be \\nable to call off Luca. You have to worry about Luca. /V/have \\nto worry about Luca if I go for your deal.’ \\n\\nSollozzo said quietly, ‘I’ll take care of Luca. You take care \\nof Sonny and the other two kids. Listen, you can tell them that \\nFreddie would have got it today with his old man but my \\npeople had strict orders not to gun him. 1 didn’t want any \\nmore hard feelings than necessary. You can tell them that, \\nFreddie is alive because of me.’ \\n\\nFinally Hagen’s mind was working. For the first time he \\nreally believed that Sollozzo did not mean to kill him or hold \\nhim as a hostage. The sudden relief from fear that flooded his \\nbody made him flush with shame. Sollozzo watched him with \\na quiet understanding smile. Hagen began to think things out. \\nIf he did not agree to argue Sollozzo’s case, he might be killed. \\nBut then he realized that Sollozzo expected him only to \\n\\n\\n90 \\n\\n\\n\\npresent it and present it properly, as he was bound to do as a \\nresponsible Consigiiori. And now, thinking about it, he also \\nrealized that SoUozzo was right. An unlimited war between the \\nTattaglias and the Corleones must be avoided at all costs. The \\nCorleones must bury their dead and forget, make a deal. And \\nthen when the time was right they could move against Sollozzo. \\n\\nBut glancing up, he realized that Sollozzo knew exactly \\nwhat he was thinking. The Turk was smiling. And then it \\nstruck Hagen. What had happened to Luca Brasi that Sollozzo \\nwas so unconcerned? Had Luca made a deal? He remembered \\nthat on the night Don Corleone had refused Sollozzo, Luca \\nhad been summoned into the office for a private conference \\nwith the Don. But now was not the time to worry about such \\ndetails. He had to get back to the safety of the Corleone Family \\nfortress in Long Beach. ‘TU do my best/ he said to Sollozzo. \\n‘I believe you’re right, it’s even what the Don would want us \\nto do.’ \\n\\nSollozzo nodded gravely. ‘Fine,’ he said. ‘I don’t like blood- \\nshed, I’m a businessman and blood costs too much money.’ \\nAt that moment the phone rang and one of the men sitting \\nbehind Hagen went to answer it. He listened and then said \\ncurtly, ‘OK, I’ll tell him.’ He hung up the phone, went to \\nSollozzo’s side and whispered in the Turk’s ear. Hagen saw \\nSollozzo’s face go pale, his eyes glitter with rage. He himself \\nfelt a thrill of fear. Sollozzo was looking at him speculatively \\nand suddenly Hagen knew that he was no longer going to be \\nset free. That something had happened that might mean his \\ndeath. Sollozzo said, ‘ The old man is still alive. Five bullets in his \\nSicilian hide and he’s still alive.’ He gave a fatalistic shrug. ‘ Bad \\nluck,\\' he said to Hagen. ‘Bad luck for me. Bad luck for you.’ \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOUR \\n\\nWhkn Michael Corleone arrived at his father’s house in Long \\nBeach he found the narrow entrance mouth of the mall \\nblocked off with a link chain. The mall itself was bright with \\n\\n91 \\n\\n\\n\\nthe floodlights of all eight houses, outlining at least ten cars \\nt>arked along the curving cement walk. \\n\\nTwo men he didn\\'t know were leaning against the chain. \\nOne of them asked in a Brooklyn accent, * Who\\'rc you?* \\n\\nHe told them. Another man came out of the nearest house \\nand peered at his face. * That’s the Don’s kid,* he said. *l’ll \\nbring him inside.’ Mike followed this man to his father’s \\nhouse, where two men at the door let him and his escort pass \\ninside. \\n\\nThe house seemed to be full of men he didn’t know, until he \\nwent into the living room. There Michael saw Tom Hagen’s \\nwife, Theresa, sitting stiflly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette. \\nOn the coflee table in front of her was a glass of whisky. On \\nthe other side of the sofa sat the bulky Clememca. The eapm9- \\nface was impassive, but he was sweating and the dgar \\nin his hand glistened slickly black with his saliva. \\n\\nGemenaa came to wri^g his hand in a consoling way, \\nmuttering, *Yout mother u at the hospital with your father, \\nhe’s going to be all right!* Paulie Gatto stood up to shake \\nhands. Michael looked at him curiously. He knew Paulie was \\nhis father’s bodyguard hht did not know that Paulie had \\nstayed home sick that day. But he sensed tension in the thin \\ndark face. He knew Gatto’s reputation as an up-and-coming \\nman, a very quick man who knew how to get delicate )obs \\ndone without complications, and today he had failed in his \\nduty. He noticed several other men in the comers of the room \\nbut he did not recogniae them. They were not of Gemenaa’s \\npeople. Michael put these facts together and understood. \\nGemenza and Gatto were suspect. Thinking that Paulie had \\nbeen at the scene, he asked the ferret-faced young man, *^How \\nis Freddie? He OK?’ \\n\\n*The doctor gave him a shot,’ Gemenza said. ‘He’s sleep- \\ning.’ \\n\\nMichael went to Hagen’s wife and bent down to kiss her \\ncheck. They had always liked each other. He whispered, \\n‘Don’t worry, Tom will be OK. Have you talked to Sonny \\nyet?’ \\n\\nTheresa clung to him for a moment and shook her head. \\nShe was a delicate, very pretty woman, more American than \\n\\n\\n9 ^ \\n\\n\\n\\nItalian, and very scared. He took her hand and lifited her ofF die \\nsofa. Then he led her into his father’s comet room office. \\n\\nSonny was sprawled out in his chair behind the desk holding \\na yellow pad in one hand and a pencil in the other. The only \\nother man in the room with him was the caporegrme Tessio, \\nwhom Michael recognized and immediately realized that it \\nmust be his men who were in the house and forming the new \\npalace guard. He too had a pencil and pad in his hands. \\n\\nWhen Sonny saw them he came from behind his desk and \\ntook Hagen’s wife in his arms. ‘Don’t worry, Theresa,’ he \\nsaid. ‘Tom’s OK. They just wanta give him die proposidon, \\nthey said they’d turn him loose. He’s not on the operating end, \\nhe’s just out lawyer. There’s no reason for anybody to do him \\nharm.’ \\n\\nHe released Theresa and then to Michael’s surprise he, too, \\ngot a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He pushed Sonny away and \\nsaid grinning, ‘After I get used to you beating me up I gotta \\nput up with this?’ They had often fought when they were \\nyounger. \\n\\nSonny shrugged. ‘Listen, kid, I was worried when I couldn’t \\nget ahold of you in that hick town. Not that I gave a crap if \\nthey knocked you ofif, but I didn’t like the idea of bringing the \\nnews to the old lady. 1 had to tell her about Pop.’ \\n\\n‘How’d she take it?’ Michael asked. \\n\\n‘Good,’ Sonny said. ‘She’s been through it before. Me too. \\nYou were too young to know about it and then things got \\npretty smooth while you were growing up.’ He paused and \\nthen said, ‘ She’s down at the hospital with the old man. He’s \\ngonna pull through.’ \\n\\n‘How about us going down?’ Michael asked. \\n\\nSonny shook his head and said dryly, ‘1 can’f leave this \\nhouse until it’s all over.’ The phone rang. Sonny picked it up \\nand listened intently, ^^liilc he was listening Michael sauntered \\nover to the desk and glanced down at the yellow pad Sonny \\nhad been writing on. There was a list of seven names. The first \\nthree were Sollozzo, Phillip Tattaglia, and John Tattaglia. It \\nstruck Michael with full force that he had interrupted Sonny \\nand Tessio as they were making up a list of men to be killed. \\n\\nWhen Sonny hung up the phone he said to Theresa Hagen \\n\\n\\n93 \\n\\n\\n\\nand Michael, *Can you two wait outside? I got some business \\nwith Tessio we have to finish/ \\n\\nHagen’s wife said, ‘Was that call about Tom?’ She said it \\nalmost truculently but she was weeping with fright. Sonny put \\nhis arm around her and led her to the door. ‘I swear he’s \\ngoing to be OK,’ he said. ‘Wait in the living room. I’ll come \\nout as soon as I hear something.* He shut the door behind her. \\nMichael had sat down in one of the big leather armchairs. \\nSonny gave him a quick sharp look and then went to sit do\\\\^m \\nbehind the desk. \\n\\n‘You hang around me, Mike,* he said, ‘you’re gonna hear \\nthings you don’t wanta hear.’ \\n\\nMichael lit a cigarette. T can help out,’ he said. \\n\\n‘No, you can’t,’ Sonny said. ‘The old man would be sore as \\nhell if I let you get mixed up in tliis.* \\n\\nMichael stood up and yelled. ‘You lousy bastard, he’s my \\nfather. I’m not supposed to help him? 1 can help. 1 don’t have \\nto go out and kiil people but I can help. Stop treating me like a \\nkid brother, 1 was in the war. I got shot, remember? I killed \\nsome Japs. What the hell do you think I’ll do w^hen you knock \\nsomebody off? Faint?’ \\n\\nSonny grinned at him. ‘ Pretty soon you’ll want me to put up \\nmy dukes. OK, stick around, you can handle the phone.’ He \\nturned to Tessio. ‘That call I just got gave me dope we \\nneeded.’ He turned to Michael. ‘Somebody had to finger the \\nold man. It could have been Clemenza, it could have been \\nPaulie Gatto, who was very conveniently sick today. I know \\nthe answer now, let’s see how smart you arc, Mike, you’re the \\ncollege boy. V^lio sold out to S0U0220?’ \\n\\nMichael sat down again and relaxed back into the leather \\narmchair. He thought everything over very carefully. Qc- \\nmen2a was a caporegime in the Corleone Family structure. Don \\nCorleone had made him a millionaire and they had been inti- \\nmate friends for over twenty years. He held one of the most \\npowerful posts in the organization. What could Clemenza gain \\nfor betraying his Don? More money? He was rich enough but \\nthen men are always greedy. More power? Revenge for some \\nfancied insult or slight? That Hagen had been made the \\nConsiglhri? Or perhaps a businessman’s conviction that \\n\\n\\n94 \\n\\n\\n\\nSollozzo would win out? No, it was impossible for Clcmcnza \\nto be a traitor, and then Michael thought sadly it was only im- \\npossible because he didn’t want Clemenza to die. The fat man \\nhad always brought him gifts when he was growing up, had \\nsometimes taken him on outings when tbe Don had been too \\nbusy. He could not believe that Clemenza was guilty of \\ntreachery. \\n\\nBut, on the other hand, Sollozzo would want Clemenza in \\nhis pocket more than any other man in the Corleone Family. \\n\\nMichael thought about Paulie Gatto. Paulie as yet had not \\nbecome rich. He was well thought of, his rise in the organiza- \\ntion was certain but he would have to put in liis time like \\neverybody else. Also he would have wilder dreams of power, \\nas the young always do. It had to be Paulie. And then Michael \\nremembered that in tbe sixth grade he and Paulie had been in \\nthe same class in school and he didn’t want it to be Paulie \\ncither. \\n\\nHe shook his head. * Neither one of them,* be said. But he \\nsaid it only because Sonny had said he had the answer. If it had \\nbeen a vote, he would have voted Paulie guilty. \\n\\nSonny was smiling at him. ‘Don’t worry,* he said. ‘Clemenza \\nis OK. It’s Paulie.’ \\n\\nMichael could see that Tessio was rcUeved. As a fellow \\ncaporegime his sympathy would be with Clemenza. Also the \\npresent situation was not so serious if treachery did not reach \\nso high. Tessio said cautiously, ‘Then I can send my people \\nhome tomorrow?’ \\n\\nSonny said, ‘ The day after tomorrow. I don’t want anybody \\nto know about this until then. Listen, I want to talk some \\nfamily business with my brother, personal. Wai\\\\ out in the \\nliving room, eh ? We can finish our list later. You and Clemenza \\nwill work together on it.’ \\n\\n‘Sure,’ Tessio said. He went out. \\n\\n‘How do you know for sure it’s Paulie?* Michael asked. \\n\\nSonny said, ‘ We have people in the telephone company and \\nthey tracked down all of Paulic’s phone calls in and out. \\nClemenza’s too. On the three days Paulie was sick this \\nmonth he got a call from a street booth across from tbe old \\nman’s building. Today too. They were checking to see if \\n\\n9J \\n\\n\\n\\nPaulie was coming down or somebody was being sent down to \\ntake his place. Or for some other reason. It doesn’t matter.’ \\nSonny shrugged. * Thank God it was Paulie. We’ll need \\nClemenza bad.’ \\n\\nMichael asked hesitantly^ ‘Is it going to be an all-out war?* \\n\\nSonny’s eyes were hard. ‘That’s how I’m going to play it as \\nsoon as Tom checks in. Until the old man tells me different.’ \\n\\nMichael asked, ‘ So why don’t you wait until the old man can \\ntell you?’ \\n\\nSonny looked at him curiously. ‘ How the hell did you win \\nthose combat medals? We are under the gun, man, we gotta \\nfight. I’m just afraid they won’t let Tom go.* \\n\\nMichael was surprised at this. ‘Why not?’ \\n\\nAgain Sonny’s voice was patient. ‘They snatched Tom \\nbecause they figured the old man was finished and they could \\nmake a deal with me and Tom would be the sit-down guy in \\nthe preliminary stages, carry the proposition. Now with the \\nold man alive they know I can’t make a deal so Tom’s no good \\nto them. They can turn him loose or dump him, depending \\nhow Sollozzo feels. If they dump him, it would be just to show \\n08 they really mean business, trying to bulldoze us.’ \\n\\nMichael said quiedy, ‘What made S0II0220 think he could \\nget a deal with you?’ \\n\\nSonny flushed and he didn’t answer for a moment. Then he \\nsaid, ‘ We had a meeting a few months ago, S0II0Z20 came to \\nus with a proposition on drugs. The old man turned him \\ndown. But during the meeting I shot off my mouth a little, I \\nshowed I wanted the deal. Which is absolutely the wrong \\nthing to do; if there’s one thing the old man hammered into \\nme it’s never to do a thing like that, to let other people know \\nthere*^ a split of opinion in the Family. So Sollozzo figures he \\ngets rid of the old man, 1 have to go in with him on the drugs. \\nWith the old man gone, the Family power is cut at least in half. \\n1 would be fighting for my life anyway to keep all the busi- \\nnesses the old man got together. Drugs are the coming thing, \\nwe should get into it. And his knocking off the old man is \\npurely business, nothing personal. As a matter of business 1 \\nwould go in with him. Of course he would never let me get \\ntoo close, he’d make sure I’d never get a clean shot at him, just \\n\\n96 \\n\\n\\n\\nin case. But he also knows that once I accepted the deal the \\nother Families would never let me start a war a couple of years \\nlater just for revenge. Also, the Tattaglia Family is behind \\nhim .* \\n\\n‘If they had got the old man, what would you have \\ndone?’ Michael asked. \\n\\nSonny said very simply, * S0II0220 is dead meat. I don’t care \\nwhat it costs. I don’t care if we have to fight all the five \\nFamilies in New York. The Tattaglia Family is going to be \\nwiped out. I don’t care if we all go down together.’ \\n\\nMichael said softly, ‘ That’s not how Pop would have played \\nit.’ \\n\\nSonny made a violent gesture. ‘I know I’m not the man he \\nwas. But I’ll tell you this and he’ll tell you too. When it comes \\nto real action I can operate as good as anybody, short-range. \\nS0II0220 knows that and so do Clemen2a and Tessio. 1 “made \\nmy bones ” when 1 was nineteen, the last time the Family had a \\nwar, and I was a big help to the old man. So I’m not worried \\nnow. And our Family has all the horses in a deal like this. I just \\nwish we could get contact with Luca.’ \\n\\nMichael asked curiously, .‘Is Luca that tough, like they say? \\nIs he that good?’ \\n\\nSonny nodded. ‘He’s in a class by himself. I’m going to send \\nhim after the three Tattaglias. I’U get S0II0220 myself.’ \\n\\nMichael shifted uneasily in his chair. He looked at his older \\nbrother. He remembered Sonny as being sometimes casually \\nbrutal but essentially warmhearted. A nice guy. It seemed \\nunnatural to hear him talking this way, it was chilling to see \\nthe list of names he had scribbled down, men to be executed, \\nas if he were some newly crowned Roman Emperor. He was \\nglad-that he was not truly part of all this, that novc his father \\nlived he did not have to involve himself in vengeance. He’d \\nhelp out, answering the phone, running errands and messages. \\nSonny and the old man could take care of themselves,. especi- \\nally with Luca behind them. \\n\\nAt that moment they heard a woman scream in the living \\nroom. Oh, Christ, Michael thought, it sounded like Tom’s \\nwife. He rushed to the door and opened it. Everybody In the \\nliving foom was standing. And by the sofe Tom Hagen was \\n\\n97 \\n\\nGod&ther— 4 \\n\\n\\n\\nholding Theresa close to him, his face embarrassed. Theresa \\nwas weeping and sobbing, and Michael realized that the \\nscream he had heard had been her calling out her husband’s \\nname with joy. As he watched, Tom Hagen disentangled him- \\nself from his wife’s arms and lowered her back onto the sofa. \\nHe smiled at Michael grimly. ‘Glad to sec you, Mike, really \\nglad.’ He strode into the office without another look at his \\nstill -sobbing wife. He hadn’t lived with the Corleone Familv \\nten years for nothing, Michael thought with a queer flush \\nof pride. Some of the old man had rubbed off on him, as it \\nhad on Sonny, and he thought, with surprise, even on \\nhimself. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIVE \\n\\n\\nIt w AS nearly four o’clock in the morning as they all sat in the \\ncorner room office - Sonny, Michael, Tom Hagen, Clemenza, \\nand Tcssio. Theresa Hagen had been persuaded to go to her \\nown home next door. Paulie Gatto was still waiting in the \\nliving room, not knowing that Tessio’s men had been in- \\nstructed not to let him leave or let him out of their sight. \\n\\nTom Hagen relayed the deal SoUozzo oflercd. He told how \\nafter SoUozzo had learned the Don still lived, it was obvious \\nthat he meant to kiU Hagen, Hagen grinned. ‘If I ever plead \\nbefore the Supreme Court, I’ll never plead better than I did \\nwith that goddamn Turk tonight. I told him I’d talk the \\nFamily into the deal even though the Don was alive. I told \\nhim I could wrap you around ray finger. Sonny. How we were \\nbuddies as kids; and don’t get sore, but I let him get the idea \\nthat maybe you weren’t too sorry about getting the old man’s \\njob, God forgive me.’ He smiled apologetically at Sonny, who \\nmade a gesture signifying that he understood, that it was of no \\nconsequence. \\n\\nMichael, leaning back in his armchair with the phone at his \\nright hand, studied both men. When Hagen had entered the \\n\\n98 \\n\\n\\n\\nroom Sonny had come rushing to embrace him. Michael \\nrealized with a faint twinge of jealousy that in many ways \\nSonny and Tom Hagen were closer than he himself could ever \\nbe to his own brother. \\n\\n* Let’s get down to business/ Sonny said. * We have to make \\nplans. Take a look at this list me and Tessio made up. Tessio, \\ngive Clemenza your copy.’ \\n\\n‘If we make plans/ Michael said, \\'Freddie should be here.’ \\n\\nSonny said grimly, ‘Freddie is no use to us. The doctor \\nsays he’s in shock so bad he has to have complete rest. 1 don’t \\nunderstand that. Freddie was always a pretty tough guy. 1 \\nguess seeing the old man gunned down was hard on him, he \\nalways thought the Don was God. He wasn’t like you and me, \\nMike.’ \\n\\nHagen said quickly, ‘ O K, leave Freddie out. Leave him out \\nof everything, absolutely everything. Now, Sonny, until this \\nis all over I think you should stay in the house. 1 mean never \\nleave it. You’re safe here. Don’t underrate Sollozzo, he’s got \\nto be a pe^pfiovantt^ a real .90 calibre. Is the hospital covered?’ \\n\\nSonny nodded. ‘The cops have it locked in and I got my \\npeople there visiting Pop all the time. What do you think of \\nthat list, Tom?’ \\n\\nHagen frowned down at the list of names. ‘Jesus Christ, \\nSonny, you’re really taking this personal. The Don would \\nconsider it a purely business dispute. Sollozzo is the key. Get \\nrid of Sollozzo and everything fdls in line. You don’t have to \\ngo after the Tattaglias.’ \\n\\nSonny looked at his two caporegimes. Tessio shrugged. ‘It’s \\ntricky,’ he said. Qemenza didn’t answer at all. \\n\\nSonny said to Qemenza, ‘One thing w\\'e can tgke care of \\nwithout discussion. I don’t want Paulie around here any more. \\nMake that first on your list.’ The fat caporegime nodded. \\n\\nHagen said, \\'\\\\^at about Luca? Sollozzo didn’t seem \\nworried about Luca. That worries me. If Luca sold us out, we’re \\nin real trouble. That’s the first thing we have to know. Has \\nanybody been able to get in touch with him?’ \\n\\n‘No,’ Sonny said. ‘I’ve been calling him all night. Maybe \\nhe’s shacked up.* \\n\\n‘No,’ Hagen said. ‘He never sleeps over with a broad. He \\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\n\\nalways goes home when he’s thtoogli* M&e» keq> ringifig his \\nnumber until you get an answer/ Michael dutifully picked up \\nthe phone and dialled. He could hear the phone ringing on tlK \\nother end but no one answered. Finally he hung up. ‘Keep \\ntrying every fifteen minutes/ Hagen said. \\n\\nSonny said impatiendy, ‘OK, Tom you’re the Consigiiori^ \\nhow about some advice? What the hell do you think we should \\ndo?’ \\n\\nHagen helped himself to the whisky bottle on the desk. \\n‘We negotiate with Solloazo tmtil your father is in shape to \\ntake charge. We might even make a deal if we have to. ^^en \\nyour hither gets out of bed he can setde the whole business \\nwithout a fuss and all the Families will go along with him.’ \\n\\nSonny said angrily, ‘You think 1 can’t handle this guy \\nSoUozao?’ \\n\\nTom Hagen looked him directly in the eye. ‘ Sonny, sure you \\ncan outfight him. The Corleone Family has the power. You \\nhave Clemenza and Tessio here and they can muster a thousand \\nmen if it comes to an all-out war. But at the end there will be a \\nshambles over the whole East Coast and all the other Families \\nwill blame the Corleones. We’ll make a lot of enemies. And \\nthat’s something your father never believed in.’ \\n\\nMichael, watching Soimy, thought he took this well. But \\nthen Sonny said to Hagen, ‘What if the old man dies, what do \\nyou advise then, ConsiglioriV \\n\\nHagen said quietly, ‘I know you won’t do it, but 1 would \\nadvise you to make a real deal with Sollozzo on the drugs. \\nWithout your father’s political contacts and personal influence \\nthe Corleone Family loses half its stieng^. Without your \\nfather, the other New York Families might wind up support- \\ning the Tattaglias and SoUozzo just to make sure there isn’t a \\nlong destructive war. If your father dies, make the deal. Then \\nwait and see/ \\n\\nSonny was white-faced with anger. ‘ That’s easy for you to \\nsay, it’s not your father they killed.’ \\n\\nHagen said quickly and proudly, ‘1 was as good a son to \\nhim as you or Mike, maybe better. I’m giving you a profes- \\nsional opinion. Personally I want to kill ail those basUrds.’ \\nThe emotion in his voice shamed Sonny, who said, ‘Oh, \\n\\n\\nlOO \\n\\n\\n\\nChritt, Tom, 1 didn’t mmn it that wmy* But he had, ceally. \\nBlood was blood and nothing dte was its equal. \\n\\nSonny brooded for a moment as the others waited in em* \\nbarrassed silence. Then he sighed and spoke quietly. ’OK, \\nwe’ll sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But, Tom, \\n1 want you to stay inside the mall, too. Don’t take any chances. \\nMike, you be careful, though I don’t think even SoUozao \\nwould bring personal family into the war. Everybody would \\nbe against him then. But be careful. Tessio, you hold your \\npeople in reserve but have them nosing around the city. Qe- \\nmenza, after you settle the Paulic Gatto thing, you move your \\nmen into the house and the mall to replace Tessio’s people. \\nTessio, you keep your men at the hospital, though. Tom, start \\nnegotiation over the phone or by messenger with SoUozzo and \\nthe Tattaglias the first thing in the morning. Mike, tomorrow \\nyou take a couple of Qemenza’s people and go to Luca’s house \\nand wait for him to show up or find out where the hell he is. \\nThat crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if \\nhe’s heard the news. 1 can’t believe he’d ever go against hia \\nOcm, no matter what the Turk ofiered him.’ \\n\\nHagen said reluctantly, ’Maybe Mike shouldn’t get mised \\nop in this so directly.’ \\n\\n’Right,’ Sonny said. ’Forget that, Mike. Anyway 1 need you \\non the phone here in the bouse, that’s more important.’ \\n\\nMichael didn’t say anything. He. felt awkward, almost \\nashamed, and he noticed Qemenza and Tessio with faces so \\ncarefully impassive ihat he was sure that they were hiding \\ntheir contempt. He picked up the phone and dialled Luca \\nBrasi’s numb^ and kept the receiver to his car as it rang and \\ntang. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX \\n\\nPeter Clemenz A slept badly thatnight. In the morning he got \\nup early and made his own breakfast of a glass of grappa^ a \\nthick slice of Genoa salami with a chunk of fresh Italian bread \\n\\n\\nlOl \\n\\n\\n\\nthat was still delivered to his door as in the old days. Then he \\ndrank a great, plain china mug filled with hot coffee that had \\nbeen laced with anisette. But as he padded about the house in \\nhis old bathrobe and red felt slippers he pondered on the day’s \\nwork that lay ahead of him. Last night Sonny Corleone had \\nmade it very dear that Paulie Gatto was to be taken care of \\nimmediately. It had to be today. \\n\\nClemenza was troubled. Not because Gatto had been his \\nprotege and had turned traitor. This did not reflect on the \\nt,aporeffme*s judgement. After all, Paulie’s background had \\nbeen perfect He came from a Sicilian family, he had grown up \\nin the same neighbourhood as the Corleone children, had \\nindeed even gone to school with one of the sons. He had been \\nbrought up through each levd in the proper manner. He had \\nbeen tested and not found wanting. And then after he had \\n\\'made his bones’ he had received a good living from the \\nFamily, a percentage of an East Side ‘ book ’ and a union pay- \\nroll slot. Qemen2a had not been unaware that Paulie Gatto \\nsupplemented his income with freelance stick ups, strictly \\nagainst the Family rules, but even this was a sign of the man’s \\nworth. The breaking of such regulations was considered a \\nsign of high-spiritedness, like that shown by a fine racing horse \\nfighting the reins. \\n\\nAnd Paulie had never caused trouble with his stick ups. \\nThey had always been meticulously planned and carried out \\nwith the minimum of fuss and trouble, with no one ever get- \\nting hurt : a three-thousand-doUar Manhattan garment centre \\npayroll, a small chinaware factory payroll in the slums of \\nBrooklyn. After all, a young man could always use some extra \\npocket money. It was all in the pattern. Who could ever fore- \\ntell that Paulie Gatto would turn traitor? \\n\\nWhat was troubling Peter Qemenza this morning was an \\nadministrative problem. The actual execution of Gatto was a \\ncut-and-dried chore. The problem was, who should the \\ncaporegime bring up from the ranks to replace Gatto in the \\nFamily? It was an important promotion, that to ‘button’ man, \\none not to be handed out lightly. The man had to be tough and \\nhe had to be smart. He had to be safe, not a person that would \\ntalk to the police if he got in trouble, one well saturated in the \\n\\n\\n102 \\n\\n\\n\\nSicilians’ law of omtrta^ the law of silence. And then, what kind \\nof a living would he receive for his new duties ^ Clcmenza had \\nseveral times spoken to the Don about better rewards for the \\nall-important button man who was first in the front line when \\ntrouble arose, but the Don had put him off. If Paulic had been \\nmaking more money, he might have been able to resist the \\nblandishments of the wily Turk, Sollo2zo. \\n\\nGemenza finally narrowed down the list of candidates to \\nthree men. The first was an enforcer who worked with the \\ncoloured policy bankers in Harlem, a big brawny brute of a \\nman of great physical strength, a man with a great deal of \\npersonal charm who could get along with people and yet \\nwhen necessary make them go in fear of him. But Gemenza \\nscratched him off the list after considering his name for a half \\nhour. This man got along too well with the black people, \\nwhich hinted at some flaw of character. Also he would be too \\nhard to replace in the position he now held. \\n\\nThe second name Gemenza considered and almost settled \\non was a hard-working chap who served faithfully and well in \\nthe organization. This man was the collector of delinquent \\naccounts for Family-licensed shylocks in Manhattan. He had \\nstarted off as a bookmaker’s runner. But he was not quite yet \\nready for such an important promotion. \\n\\nFinally he settled on Rocco Lampone. Lampone had served \\na short but impressive apprenticeship in the Family. During \\nthcL war he had been wounded in Africa and been discharged \\nin 1943. Because of the shortage of young men, Gemenza had \\ntaken him on even though Lampone was partially incapaci- \\ntated by his injuries and walked with a pronounced limp. Ge- \\nmenza had used him as a black-market contact in the garment \\ncentre and with government employees controlling OP A food \\nstamps. From that, Lampone had graduated to troubleshooter \\nfor the whole operation. What Gemenza liked about him was \\nhis good judgement. He knew that there was no percentage in \\nbeing tough about something that would only cost a heavy \\nfine or six months in jail, small prices to pay for the enormous \\nprofits earned. He had the good sense to know that it was not \\nan area for heavy threats but light ones. He kept the whole \\noperation in a minor key, which was exactly what was needed. \\n\\n\\n\\nQemenza fdt the relief of a conscientious administrator \\nwho has solved a knotty personnel problem. Yes, it would be \\nRocco Lampone who would assist. For Gemenza planned to \\nhandle this job himself, not only to help a new, inexperienced \\nman \\'make bis bones’, but to settle a personal score with \\nPaulie Gatto. Paulie had been his prot^g^, he had advanced \\nPaulie over the heads of more deserving and more loyal people, \\nhe had helped Paulie \\'make his bones’ and furthered his career \\nin every way. Paulie had not only betrayed the Family, he had \\nbetrayed his padrone^ Peter Gemenza. This lack of respect had \\nto be repaid. \\n\\nEverything else was arranged. Paulie Gatto had been in- \\nstructed to pick him up at three in the afternoon, and to pick \\nhim up with his own car, nothing hot. Now Gemenza took up \\nthe telephone and dialled Rocco Lampone’s number. He did \\nnot identify himself. He simply said, ‘Come to my house, \\nI have an errand for you.’ He was pleased to note that \\ndespite the early hour, Lampone’s voice was not surprised \\nor dazed with sleep and he simply said, *OK.’ Good man. \\nGemenza added, ‘No rush, have your breakfast and lunch \\nfirst before you come see me. But not later than two in the \\nafternoon,’ \\n\\nThere was another laconic OK on the other end and \\nGemenza hung up the phone. He had already alerted his \\npeople about replacing caporegimi Tessio’s people in the Cor- \\nleone mall so that was done. He had capable subordinates and \\nnever interfered in a mechanical operation of that kind. \\n\\nHe decided to wash his Cadillac. He loved the car. It gave \\nhim such a quiet peaceful ride, and its upholstery was so rich \\nthat he sometimes sat in it for an hour when the weather was \\ngood bexause it was more pleasant than sitting in the house. \\nAnd it always helped him think when he was grooming the \\ncar. He remembered his father in Italy doing the same thing \\nwith donkeys. \\n\\nGemenza worked inside the heated garage, he hated cold. \\nHe ran over his plans. You had to be careful with Paulie, the \\nman was like a rat, he could smeU danger. And now of course \\ndespite being so tough he must be shitting in his pants because \\ndie old man was still alive. He’d be as skittish as a donkey with \\n\\n\\n104 \\n\\n\\n\\nants up his ass. But Qemen^a was accustomed to these cir- \\ncumstances, usual in his work. First, he had to have a good \\nexcuse for Rocco to accompany them. Second, he had to have \\na plausible mission for the three of them to go on. \\n\\nOf course, strictly speaking, this was not necessary. Paulie \\nGatto could be killed without any of these frills. He was locked \\nin, he could not run away. But Clemenaa felt strongly that it \\nwas important to keep good working habits and never give \\naway a fraction of a percentage point. You never could tell \\nwhat might happen and these matters were, after all, questions \\nof life and death. \\n\\nAs he washed his baby-blue Cadillac, Peter Qemen^a pon- \\ndered and rehearsed his lines, the expressions of his face. He \\nwould be curt with Paulie, as if displeased with him. With a \\nman so sensitive and suspicious as Gatto this would throw \\nhim oft\\' the track or at least leave him uncertain. Undue \\nfriendliness would make him wary. But of course the curtness \\nmust not be too angry. It had to be rather an absentminded \\nsort of irritation. And why Lampone? Paulie would find that \\nmost alarming, especially since lampone had to be in the rear \\nseat. Paulie wouldn’t like being hdpless at the wheel with \\nLampone behind his head. Clemenza rubbed and polished the \\nmetal of his Cadillac furiously. It was going to be tricky. Very \\ntricky. For a moment he debated whether to recruit another \\nman but decided against it. Here he followed basic reasoning. \\nIn years to come a situation might arise where it might be \\nprofitable for one of his partners to testify against him. If there \\nwere just one accomplice it was one’s word against the other. \\nBut the word of a second accomplice could swing the balance. \\nNo, they would stick to procedure. • \\n\\nWhat annoyed Qemenza was that the execution had to be \\n•public’. That is, the body was to be found. He would have \\nmuch preferred having it disappear. (Usual burying grounds \\nwere the nearby ocean or the swamplands of New Jersey on \\nland owned by fidends of the Family or by other more complic- \\nated methods.) But it had to be public so that embryo traitors \\nwould be frightened and the enemy warned that the Corleone \\nFamily had by no means gone stupid of soft, ^ollozzo would \\nbe made wary by this quick discovery of his spy. The Corleone \\n\\n\\n105 \\n\\n\\n\\nFamily would win back some of its prestige. It had been made \\nto look foolish by the shooting of the old man, \\n\\nClemenza sighed. The Cadillac gleamed like a huge blue \\nsteel egg, and he was nowhere near the solving of his prob- \\nlem. Then the solution hit him, logical and to the point. It \\nwould explain Rocco Lampone, himself, and Paulie being \\ntogether and give them a mission of sufficient secrecy and \\nimportance. \\n\\nHe would tell Paulie that their job today was to find an \\napartment in case the Family decided to ‘ go to the mattresses ’. \\n\\nWhenever a war between the Families became bitterly in- \\ntense, the opponents would set up headquarters in secret \\napartments where the ‘soldiers’ could sleep on mattresses \\nscattered through the rooms. This was not so much to keep \\ntheir families out of danger, their wives and little children, \\nsince any attack on noncombatants was undreamed of. All \\nparties were too vulnerable to similar retaliation. But it was \\nalways smarter to live in some secret place where your every- \\nday movements could not be charted either by your opponents \\nor by some police who might arbitrarily decide to meddle. \\n\\nAnd so usually a trusted caporegime would be sent out to \\nrent a secret apartment and fill it with mattresses. That apart- \\nment would be used as a sally port into the city when an \\noffensive was mounted. It was ni&tural for Clemenza to be sent \\non such an errand. It was natural for him to take Gatto and \\nLampone with him to arrange all the details, ixicluding the \\nfurnishing of the apartment. Also, Clemenza thought with a \\ngrin, Paulie Gatto had proved he was greedy and the first \\nthought that would pop into his head was how much he could \\nget from Sollozzo for this valuable intelligence. \\n\\nRoedb Lampone arrived earl]\\' and Clemenza explained what \\nhad to be done and what their roles would be, Lampone’s face \\nlit up with surprised gratitude and he thanked Gemenza \\nrespectfully for the promotion allowing him to serve the \\nFamily. Gemenza was sure he had done well. He clapped \\nLampone on the shoulder and said, ‘You’ll get something \\nbetter for your living after today. We’ll talk about that later. \\nYou understand the Family now is occupied with more critical \\nmatters, more important things to do.’ Lampone made a \\n\\n106 \\n\\n\\n\\ngesture that said he would be patient, knowing his reward was \\ncertain. \\n\\nClemenza went to his den’s safe and opened it. He took out \\na gun and gave it to Lampone. ‘Use this one,’ he said. ‘They \\ncan never trace it. Leave it in the car with Paulie. When this \\njob is finished I want you to take your wife and children on a \\nvacation to Florida. Use your own money now and I’ll pay you \\nback later. Relax, get the sun. Use the Family hotel in Miami \\nBeach so Fll know where I can get you when I want.’ \\n\\nClemenza’s wife knocked on the door of the den to tell them \\nthat Paulie Gatto had arrived. He was parked in the driveway. \\nClemenza led the way through the garage and Lampone fol- \\nlowed him. When Clemenza got into the front seat with Gatto \\nhe merely grunted in greeting, an exasperated look on his face. \\nHe looked at the wrist watch as if he expected to find that \\nGatto was late. \\n\\nThe ferret-faced button man was watching him intently, \\nlooking for a clue. He flinched a little \\'when Lampone got into \\nthe rear seat behind him and said, ‘ Rocco, sit on the other side. \\nA big guy like you blocks up my rear- view mirror.’ Lampone \\nshifted dutifully so that he was sitting behind Clemenza, as if \\nsuch a request was the most natural thing in the world. \\n\\nClemenza said sourly to Gatto, ‘Damn that Sonny, he\\'s \\nrunning scared. He’s already thinking of going to the mat- \\ntresses. We have to find a place on the West Side. Paulie, you \\nand Rocco gotta staff and supply it until the word comes \\ndown for the rest of the soldiers to use it. You know a good \\nlocation?’ \\n\\nAs he had expected, Gatto’s eyes became greedily interested. \\nPaulie had swallowed the bait and because he w^^s thinking \\nhow much the information was worth to Sollozzo, he was for- \\ngetting to think about whether he was in danger. Also, Lam- \\npone was acting his part perfectly, staring out the window in a \\ndisinterested, relaxed way. Clemenza congratulated himself on \\nhis choice. \\n\\nGatto shrugged. T’d have to think about it,’ he said. \\n\\nClemenza grunted. ‘Drive while you think, I want to get to \\nNew York today.’ \\n\\nPaulie was an expert driver and traffic going into the dty \\n\\n107 \\n\\n\\n\\nwas light at this time in the afternoon, so the early winter \\ndarkness was just beginning to fall when they arriTed. There \\nwas no small talk in the car. Qemenza directed Paulie to drive \\nup to the Washington Heights section. He checked a few \\napartment buildings and told him to park near Arthur Avenue \\nand wait. He also left Rocco Lampone in the car. He went into \\nthe Vera Mario Restaurant and had a light dinner of veal and \\nsalad, nodding his helloes to some acquaintances. After an \\nhour had gone by he walked the several blocks to where the \\ncar was parked and entered it. Gatto and Lampone were still \\nwaiting. ‘Shit,’ Clemen2a said, ‘they want us back in Long \\nBeach. They got some other job for us now. Sonny says we \\ncan let this one go until later. Rocco, you live in the city, can \\nwe drop you off? * \\n\\nRocco said quietly, ‘I have my car out at your place and my \\nold lady needs it first thing in the morning.’ \\n\\n‘That’s right,’ Clemenza said. ‘Then you have to come back \\nwith us, after all.’ \\n\\nAgain on the ride back to Long Beach nothing was said. On \\nthe stretch of road that led into the city, Clemenza said sud- \\ndenly, ‘Paulie, pull over, I gotta take a leak.’ From working \\ntogether so long, Gatto knew the fat caporegime had a weak \\nbladder. He had often made such a request. Gatto pulled the \\ncar off the highway into the soft earth that led to the swamp. \\nClemenza climbed out of the car and took a few steps into the \\nbushes. He actually relieved himself. Then as he opened the \\ndoor to get back into the car he took a quick look up and \\ndown the highway, \\'fhere were no lights, the road was com- \\npletely dark. ‘Go ahead,’ Clemenza said. A second later the \\ninterior of the car reverberated with the report of a gim. \\nPaulie Gatto seemed to jump forward, his body flinging \\nagainst the steering wheel and then slumping over to the seat. \\nClemenza had stepped back hastily to avoid being hit with \\nfragments of skull bone and blood. \\n\\nRocco Lampone scrambled out of the back seat. He still \\nheld the gun and he threw it into the swamp. He and Oemenza \\nwalked hastily to a car parked nearby and got in. Lampone \\nreached underneath the seat and found the key that had been \\nleft for them. He started the car and drove Qemenza to his \\n\\n108 \\n\\n\\n\\nhome. Then instead of going back by the same toute» he took \\nthe Jones Beach Causeway right on through to the town of \\nMerrick and onto the Meadowbrook Parkway until he reached \\nthe Northern State Parkway. He rode that to the Long Island \\nExpressway and then continued on to the Whitestone Bridge \\nand through the Bronx to his home in Manhattan. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN \\n\\n\\nOn the night before the shooting of Don Corlcone, his \\nstrongest and most loyal and most feared retainer prepared to \\nmeet with the enemy. Luca Brasi had made contact with the \\nforces of Sollozzo several months before. He had done so on \\nthe orders of Don Corlcone himself. He had done so by \\nfrequenting the nightclubs controlled by the Tattaglia Family \\nand by taking up with one of their top call girls. In bed with \\nthis call girl he grumbled about how he was held down in the \\nCorleone Family, how his worth was not recognized. After a \\nweek of this affair with the call girl, Luca was approached by \\nBruno Tattaglia, manager of the nightclub. Bruno was the \\nyoungest son, and ostensibly not connected with the Family \\nbusiness of prostitution. But his famous nightclub with its \\ndancing Line of long-stemmed beauties was the finishing school \\nfor many of the city hookers. \\n\\nThe ^st meeting was all above-board, Tattaglia offering \\nhim a job to work in the Family business as enforcer. The \\nflirtation went on for nearly a month. Luca played ^his role of \\nman infatuated with a young beautiful girl, Bruno Tattaglia \\nthe role of a businessman trying to recruit an able executive \\nfrom a rival. At one such meeting, Luca pretended to be \\nswayed, then said, ‘ But one thing must be understood. 1 will \\nnever go against the Godfather. Don Corleone is a man 1 re- \\nspect. 1 understand that he must put his sons before me in the \\nFamily business.* \\n\\nBruno Tattaglia was one of the new generation with a barely \\nhidden contempt for the old Moustache Petes like Luca Brasi, \\n\\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\n\\nDon Corlcone, and even his own father. He was just a little too \\ni-espectful. Now he said, ‘My father wouldn’t expect you to do \\nanything against the Corleones. Why should he? Everybody \\ngets along with everybody else now, it’s not like the old days. \\nIt’s just that if you’re looking for a new job, I can pass along \\nthe word to my father. There’s always need for a man like you \\nin our business. It’s a hard business and it needs hard men to \\nkeep it running smooth. Let me know if you ever make up \\nyour mind.* \\n\\nLuca shrugged. ‘It’s not so bad where I’m at.’ And so they \\nieft it. \\n\\nThe general idea had been to lead the Tattaglias to believe \\nchat he knew about the lucrative narcotics operation and that he \\nwanted a piece of it freelance. In that fashion he might hear \\nsomething about Sollozzo’s plans if the Turk had any, or \\nwhether he was getting ready to step on the toes of Don \\nCorlcone. After waiting for two months with nothing else \\nhappening, Luca reported to the Don that obviously Sol- \\n\\\\ozzo was taking his defeat graciously. The Don had told him \\nto keep trying but merely as a sideline, not to press it, \\n\\nLuca had dropped into the nightclub the evening before \\nDon Cotlconc’s being shot. Almost immediately Bruno \\nTattaglia had come to his table and sat down. \\n\\n‘ I have a friend who wants to talk to you,’ he said. \\n\\n‘ Bring him over,’ Luca said. T’ll talk to any friend of yours.’ \\n\\n‘No,’ Bruno said. ‘He wants to see you in private.’ \\n\\n‘Who is he?’ Luca asked. \\n\\n‘Just a friend of mine,’ Bruno Tattaglia said. ‘He wants to \\nput a proposition to you. Can you meet him later on tonight?’ \\n\\n‘Sure,’ Luca said. ‘What time and where?’ \\n\\nTattdglia said softly, ‘ The club closes at four in the morning. \\n^X\\'hy don’t you meet in here while the waiters are cleaning \\nup?’ \\n\\nThey knew his habits, Luca thought, they must have been \\nchecking him out. He usually got up about three or four in the \\nafternoon and had breakfast, then amused himself by. gambling \\nwith cronies in the Family or had a girl. Sometimes he saw one \\nof the midnight movies and then would drop in for a drink at \\none of the clubs. He never went to bed before dawn. So the \\n\\n\\nno \\n\\n\\n\\nsuggestion of a four a m meeting was not as outlandish as it \\nseemed. \\n\\n‘Sure, sure/ he said. ‘Til be back at four.* He left the club \\nand caught a cab to his furnished ror)m on Tenth Avenue. He \\nboarded with an Italian family to which he was distantly \\nrelated. His two rooms were separated from the rest of their \\nrailroad flat by a special door. He liked the arrangement \\nbecause it gave him some family life and also protection \\nagainst surprise where he was most vulnerable. \\n\\nThe sly Turkish fox was going to show his bushy tail, Luca \\nthought. If things went far enough, if Sollozzo committed \\nhimself tonight, maybe the whole thing could be wound up as \\na Christmas present for the Don. In his room, Luca unlocked \\nthe trunk beneath the bed and took out a bulletproof vest. It \\nwas heavy. He undressed and put it on over his woollen under- \\nwear, then put his shirt and jacket over it. He thought for a \\nmoment of calling the Don’s house at Long Beach to tell him \\nof this new development but he knew the Don never talked \\nover the phone, to anyone, and the Don had given him thiy \\nassignment in secret and so did not want anyone, not even \\nHagen or his eldest son, to know about it. \\n\\nLuca always carried a gun. He had a licence to carry a gun, \\nprobably the most expensive gun licence ever issued any place, \\nany time. It had cost a total of ten thousand dollars but it \\nwould keep him out of jail if he was frisked by the cops. As a \\ntop executive operating ofhcial of the Family he rated the \\nlicence. But tonight, just in case he could finish off the job, he \\nwanted a ‘safe’ gun. One that could not possibly be traced. \\nBut then thinking the matter over, he decided that he would \\njust listen to the proposition tonight and report back to the \\nGodfather, Don Corleone. \\n\\nHe made his way back to the club but he did not drink any \\nmore. Instead he wandered out to 48th Street, where he had a \\nleisurely late supper at Patsy’s, his favourite Italian restaurant. \\nWhen it was time for his appointment he drifted uptown to the \\nclub entrance. The doorman was no longer there when he \\nwent in. The hat-check girl was gone. Only Bruno Tattaglia \\nwaited to greet him and lead him to the deserted bar at the side \\nof the room. Before him he could see the desert of small tables \\n\\n\\n111 \\n\\n\\n\\nwith the polished yellow wood dance floor gleaming like a \\nsmall diamond in the middle of them. In the shadows was the \\nempty bandstand, out of it grew the skeleton metal stalk of a \\nmicrophone. \\n\\nLuca sat at the bar and Bruno Tattaglia went behind it. \\nLuca refused the drink offered to him and lit a cigarette. It was \\npossible that this would turn out to be something else, not the \\nTurk. But then he saw Sollozzo emerge out of the shadows at \\nthe far end of the room. \\n\\nSolloz2o shook his hand and sat at the bar next to him. \\nTattaglia put a glass in front of the Turk, who nodded his \\nthanks. *Do you know who lam?’ asked Sollozxo. \\n\\nLuca nodded. He smiled grimly. The rats were being flushed \\nout of their holes. It would be his pleasure to take care of this \\nrenegade Sicilian. \\n\\n‘Do you know what I am going to ask of you?’ SoUozzo \\nasked. \\n\\nLuca shook his head. \\n\\n‘There’s big business to be made/ S0II0220 said. ‘I mean \\nmillions for everybody at the top level. On the first shipment I \\ncan guarantee you fi^ thousand dollars. I’m talking about \\ndrugs. It’s the coming thing.’ \\n\\nLuca said, ‘Why come to me? You want me to talk to my \\nDon?’ \\n\\nSolloczo grimaced. ‘Fvc already talked to the Don. He \\nwants no part of it. All right, 1 can do without him. But I need \\nsomebody strong to protect the operation physically. I \\nunderstand you’re not happy \\'with your Family, you might \\nmake a switch.’ \\n\\nLuca shrugged. ‘If the o^ is good enough.’ \\n\\nS0II0Z20 had been watching him intently and seemed to \\nhave come to a decision. ‘Think about my offer for a few days \\nand then we’ll talk again,’ he said. He put out his hand but \\nLuca pretended not to see it and busied himself putting a \\ncigarette in his mouth. Behind the bar, Bruno Tattaglia made a \\nlighter appear magically and held it to Luca’s cigarette. And \\nthen he ^d a strange thing. He dropped the lighter on the bar \\nand grabbed Luca’s right hand, holding it tight. \\n\\nLuca reacted instantly, his body slipping off the bar stool \\n\\n\\niix \\n\\n\\n\\nand trying to twist away. But Solloaso had grabbed his other \\nhand at the wrist. Still, Luca was too strong for both of them \\nand would have broken free except that a man stepped out of \\nthe shadows behind him and threw a thin silken cord around \\nhis neck. The cord pulled tight, choking off Lucans breath. His \\nface became purple, the strength in his arms drained away. \\nTattaglia and Sollozzo held his hands easily now, and they \\nstood there curiously childlike as the man behind Luca pulled \\nthe cord around Luca’s neck tighter and tighter. Suddenly the \\nfloor was wet and slippery. Luca’s sphincter, no longer under \\ncontrol, opened, the waste of his body spilled out. There was \\nno strength in him any more and his legs folded, his body \\nsagged. Solloz2o and Tattaglia let his hands go and only the \\nstrangler stayed with the victim, sinking to his knees to follow \\nLuca’s falling body, drawing the cord so tight that it cut \\ninto the flesh of the neck and disappeared. Luca’s eyes were \\nbulging out of his head as if in the utmost surprise and this \\nsurprise was the only humanity remaining to him. He was \\ndead. \\n\\ndon’t want him found,’ Sollozzo said. ‘It’s important that \\nhe not be found right now.’ He turned on his heel and left, \\ndisappearing back into the shadows. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT \\n\\nThe DAT after the shooting of Don Corleone was a busy time \\nfor the Family. Michael stayed by the phone relaying messages \\nto Sonny. Tom Hagen was busy trying to And a mediator satis- \\nfactory to both parties so that a conference could be arranged \\nwith Sollozzo. The Turk had suddenly become cagey, perhaps \\nhe knew that the Family button men of Qemenza and Tessio \\nwere ranging far and wide over the city in an attempt to pick \\nup his trail. But Sollozzo was sticking close to his hideout, as \\nwere all top members of the TattagOa Family. This was ex- \\npected by Sonny, an elementary precaution he knew the \\nenemy was bound to take. \\n\\n\\n\\nClemen2a was tied up with Paulie Gatto. Tessio had been \\ngiven the assignment of trying to track down the whereabouts \\nof Luca Brasi. Luca had not been home since the night before \\nthe shooting, a bad sign. But Sonny could not believe that \\nBrasi had either turned traitor or had been taken by surprise. \\n\\nMama Corleonc was staying in the city with friends of the \\nFamily so that she could be near the hospital. Carlo Rizzi, the \\nson-in-law, had offered his services but had been told to take \\ncare of his own business that Don Corleone had set him up in, \\na lucrative bookmaking territory in the Italian section of Man- \\nhattan. Connie was staying with her mother in town so that \\nshe too could visit her father in the hospital. \\n\\nFreddie was still under sedation in his own room of his \\nparents’ house. Sonny and Michael had paid him a visit and \\nhad been astonished at his paleness, his obvious illness. \\n‘ Christ,* Sonny said to Michael when they left Freddie’s room, \\n*hc looks like he got plugged worse than the old man.* \\n\\nMichael shrugged. He had seen soldiers in the same condi- \\ntion on the battlefield. But he had never expected it to happen \\nto Freddie. He remembered the middle brother as being \\nphysically the toughest one in the family when all of them were \\nkids. But he had also been the most obedient son to his father. \\nAnd yet everyone knew that the Don had given up on this \\nmiddle son ever being important to the business. He wasn’t \\nquite smart enough; and failing that, not quite ruthless \\nenough. He was too retiring a person, did not have enough \\nforce. \\n\\nLate in the afternoon, Michael got a call from Johnny Fon- \\ntanc in Hollywood. Sonny took the phone. ‘Nah, Johnny, no \\nuse coming back here to see the old man. He’s too sick and it \\nwould give you a lot of bad publicity, and I know the old man \\nwouldri’t like that. Wait until he’s better and vre can move him \\nhome, then come see him. OK, I’ll give him your regards.’ \\nSonny hung up the phone. He turned to Michael and said, \\n‘That’ll make Pop happy, that Johnny wanted to fly from \\nCalifornia to see how he was.’ \\n\\nLate that afternoon, Michael was called to the listed phone \\nin the kitchen by one of Clemenza’s men. It was Kay. \\n\\n‘Is your father all right?’ she asked. Her voice was a little \\n\\n\\n\\nstrained, a little unnatural. Michael knew that she couldn’t \\nquite believe what had happened, that his father really was \\nwhat the newspapers called a gangster, \\n\\n‘He’ll be OK,’ Michael said. \\n\\n‘Can I come with you when you visit him in the hospital?’ \\nKay asked. \\n\\nMichael laughed. She had remembered him telling her how \\nimportant it was to do such things if you wanted to get along \\nwith the old Italians. ‘This is a special case,’ he said. ‘If the \\nnewspaper guys get a hold of your name and background \\nyou’U be on page three of the Daily Neufj. Girl from old \\nYankee family mixed up with son of big Mafia chief. How \\nwould your parents like that?’ \\n\\nKay said dryly, ‘My parents never read the Daily Neu/j.\\' \\nAgain there was an awkward pause and then she said, ‘You’re \\nOK, aren’t you, Mike, you’re not in any danger?* \\n\\nMike laughed again. ‘I’m known as the sissy of the Corleone \\nfamOy. No threat. So they don’t have to bother coming after \\nme. No, it’s all over, Kay, there won’t be any more trouble. \\nIt was all sort of an accident anyway. I’ll explain when I see \\nyou.’ \\n\\n‘When will that be?’ she asked. \\n\\nMichael pondered. ‘How about late tonight? We’ll have a \\ndrink and supper in your hotel and then I’ll go to the hospital \\nand see my old man. I’m getting tired of hanging around here \\nanswering phones. OK? But don’t tell anybody. I don’t want \\nnewspaper photographers snapping pictures of us together. \\nNo Iddding, Kay, it’s damned embarrassing, especially for \\nyour parents.’ \\n\\n‘AU right,’ Kay said. ‘I’ll be waiting. Can I do any Christmas \\nshopping for you ? Or anything else ? ’ \\n\\n‘No,’ Michael said. ‘Just be ready.’ \\n\\nShe gave a little excited laugh. ‘I’ll be ready,’ she said. \\n‘Aren’t I always?’ \\n\\n‘Yes, you are,’ he said. ‘That’s why you’re my best girl.’ \\n\\n‘I love you,’ she said. ‘Can you say it?’ \\n\\nMichael looked at the four hoods sitting in the kitchen. \\n‘No,’ he said. ‘Tonight, OK?’ \\n\\n‘OK,’ she said. He hung up. \\n\\n\\n”5 \\n\\n\\n\\nQcmcnza had finally come back from his day^s work and \\nwas bustling around the kitchen cooking up a huge pot of \\ntomato sauce. Michael nodded to him and went to the corner \\noffice where he found Hagen and Sonny waiting for him im- \\npatiently. ‘Is Clemenza out there?’ Sonny asked. \\n\\nMichael grinned. ‘He*s cooking up spaghetti for the troops, \\niust like the army.’ \\n\\nSonny said impatiently, ‘Tell him to cut out that crap and \\ncome on in here. I have more important things for him to do. \\nGet Tessio in here with him.’ \\n\\nIn a few minutes they were all gathered tn the office. Sonny \\nsaid curtly to Clemenza, ‘You take care of him?’ \\n\\nQemenza nodded. ‘You won’t see him any more.’ \\n\\nWith a slight electric shock, Michael realized they were \\ntalking about Paulie Gatto and that little Paulie was dead, \\nmurdered by that jolly wedding dancer, Clemenza. \\n\\nSonny asked Hagen, ‘You have any luck with Sollozzo?’ \\n\\nHagen shook his head. ‘He seems to have cooled off on the \\nnegotiation idea. Anyway he doesn’t seem to be too anxious. \\nOr maybe he’s just being very careful so that our button men \\nwon’t nail him. Anyway I haven’t been able to set up a top- \\nnotch go-between he’ll trust. But he must know he has to \\nnegotiate now. He missed his chance when he let the old man \\nget away from him.’ \\n\\nSonny said, ‘He’s a smart guy, the smartest our Family ever \\ncame up against. Maybe he figured we’re just stalling until the \\nold man gets better or we can get a line on him.’ \\n\\nHagen shrugged. ‘ Sure, be figures that. But he still has to \\nnegotiate. He has no choice. I’ll get it set up tomorrow. That’s \\ncertain.’ \\n\\nOne of Clemenza’s men knocked on the office door and \\nthen came in. He said to Clemenza, ‘It just came over the \\nradio, the cops found Paulie Gatto. Dead in his car.’ \\n\\nQemenza nodded and said to the man, ‘ Don’t worry about \\nit.’ The button man gave his capore^mi an astonished look, \\nwhich was followed by a look of comprehension, before he \\nwent back to the kitchen. \\n\\nThe conference went on as if there had been no interruption. \\nSonny asked Hagca, ‘Any change in the Don’s condition?’ \\n\\n1x6 \\n\\n\\n\\nHftgeo shook his head. *He*s OK but he won’t be able to \\ntalk fbf another couple of days. He’s all knocked out. Still re- \\ncovering from the operation. Your mother spends most of the \\nday with him, Connie too. There’s cops all over the hospital \\nand Tessio’s men hang aroimd too, just in case. In a couple of \\ndays he’ll be all right and then we can see what he wants us to \\ndo. Meanwhile we have to keep Sollozao from doing anything \\nrash. That’s why I want to start you talking deals with him.’ \\n\\nSoimy grunted. ‘Until he does, I’ve got Oemenza and \\nTessio \"looking for him. Maybe we’ll get lucky and solve the \\nwhole business.’ \\n\\n‘You won’t get lucky,* Hagen said. ‘ ScUoaso is too smart* \\nHagen paused. ‘He knows once he comes to fbe tabic ]>e*& \\nhave to go our way mpsdy. That’s why lu^s stalling. Fm \\nguessing he’s trying to line up support from the other New \\nYork Families so ^at we won’t go\\' after him when the oU \\nman gives us the word.’ \\n\\nSonny frowned. ‘ Why the hell should they do that? * \\n\\nHagen said patiently, ‘To avert a big war which hurts every- \\nbody and brings the papers and government into the act. Also, \\nSollozzo will give them a piece of the action. And you know \\nhow much dough there is in drugs. The Corleone Family \\ndoesn’t need it, we have the gambling, which is the best \\nbusiness to have. But the other Families are hungry. SoUozzo \\nis a proven man, they know he can make the operation go on a \\nbig scale. Alive he’s money in their pockets, dead he’s \\ntrouble.’ \\n\\nSonny’s face was as Michael had never seen it. The heavy \\nCupid mouth and bronzed skin seemed grey. ‘I don’t give a \\nfude what they want. They better not mess in this fight.’ \\n\\nQemenza and Tessio shifted uneasily in their chairs, infantry \\nleaders who hear their general rave about storming an im- \\npregnable hill no matter what the cost. Hagen said a little \\nimpatiently, ‘Come on. Sonny, your father wouldn’t like you \\nthinking that way. You know what he always says, “That’s a \\nwaste. ” Sure, we’re not going to let anybody stop us if the old \\nman says we go after Sollozzo. But this is oot a personal thing, \\nthis is business. If we go after the Turk and the Families inter- \\nfere, we’ll negotiate the issue. If the Families see that we’re \\n\\n\\n\\ndetemuned to have SoUozzo, they’ll let us. The Don will make \\nconcessions in other areas to square things. But don’t go blood \\ncrazy on a thing like this. It’s business. Even the shooting of \\nyour father was business, not personal. You should know that \\nby now.’ \\n\\nSonny’s eyes were still hard. ‘OK, I understand all that. Just \\nso long as you understand that nobody stands in our way \\nwhen we want SoUozzo.’ \\n\\nSonny turned to Tessio. ‘Any leads on Luca?* \\n\\nTessio shook his head. ‘None at all. SoUozzo must have \\nsnatched him.’ \\n\\nHagen said quietly, ‘SoUozzo wasn’t worried about Luca, \\nwhich struck me as funny. He’s too smart not to worry about a \\nguy like Luca. I think he maybe got him out of the picture, \\none way or the other.’ \\n\\nSonny muttered, ‘Christ, I hope Luca isn’t fighting against \\nus. That’s the one thing I’d be afraid of. Clemenza, Tessio, \\nhow do you two guys figure it?* \\n\\nQemenza said slowly, ‘Anybody could go wrong, look at \\nPaulie. But with Luca, he was a man who could only go one \\nway. The Godfather was the only thing he believed in, the \\nonly man he feared. But not only that. Sonny, he respected \\nyour father as no one else respected him and the Godfather has \\nearned respect from everyone. No, Luca would never betray \\nus. And I find it hard to believe that a man Uke SoUozzo, no \\nmatter how cunning, could surprise Luca. He was a man who \\nsuspected everyone and evcr3rthing. He was always ready for \\nthe worst. I think maybe he just went off some place for a few \\ndays. We’ll be hearing from him any time now.’ \\n\\nSonny turned to Tessio. The Brooklyn caporegime shrugged. \\n‘Any man can turn traitor. Luca was very touchy. Maybe the \\nDon offended him some way. That could be. I think though \\nthat SoUozzo gave him a little surprise. That fits in with what \\nthe ConsigHori says. We should expect the worst.’ \\n\\nSonny said to aU of them, ‘SoUozzo should get the word \\nsoon about Paulie Gatto. How will that affect him?’ \\n\\nQemenza said grimly, ‘It wiU make him think. He wiU \\nknow the Corlcone Family arc not fools. He wiU realize that he \\nwas very lucky yesterday.’ \\n\\nii8 \\n\\n\\n\\nSonny said sharply, ‘That wasn’t luck. Sollozzo was plan- \\nning that for weeks. They must have tailed the old man to his \\nofHce every day and watched his routine. Then they bought \\nPaulic off and maybe Luca. They snatched Tom right on the \\nbutton. They did everything they wanted to do. They were \\nunlucky, not lucky. Those button men they hired weren’t good \\nenough and the old man moved too quick. If they had killed \\nhim, I would have had to make a deal and Sollozzo would \\nhave won. For now. I would have waited maybe and got him \\nfive, ten years from now. But don’t call him lucky, Pete, that’s \\nunderrating him. And we’ve done that too much lately.’ \\' \\n\\nOne of the button men brought a bowl of spaghetti in from \\nthe kitchen and then some plates, forks and wine. They ate as \\nthey talked. Michael watched in amazement. He didn’t eat and \\nneither did Tom, but Sonny, Clemcnza and Tessio dug in, \\nmopping up sauce with crusts of bread. It was almost comical. \\nThey continued their discussion. \\n\\nTessio didn’t think that the loss of Paulie Gatto would upset \\nSollozzo, in fact he thought that the Turk might have antici- \\npated it, indeed might have welcomed it. A useless mouth off \\nthe payroll. And he would not be frightened by it ; after all, \\nwould they be in such a situation? \\n\\nMichael spoke up diffidently. ‘I know I’m an amateur in \\nthis, but from everything you guys have said about Sollozzo, \\nplus the fact that all of a sudden he’s out of touch with Tom, \\nI’d guess he has an ace up his sleeve. He might be ready to puU \\noff something real tricky that would put him back on top. If \\nwe could figure out what that would be, we’d be in the driver’s \\nseat.’ \\n\\nSonny said reluctantly, ‘Yeah, I thought of that and the only \\nthing 1 can figure is Luca. The word is already out that he’s to \\nbe brought here before he’s allowed any of his old rights in the \\nFamily. The only other thing I can think of is that Sollozzo has \\nmade his deal with the Families in New York and we’ll get the \\nword tomorrow that they will be against us in a war. That \\nwe’ll have to give the Turk his deal. Right, Tom?’ \\n\\nHagen nodded. ‘That’s what it looks like to me. And we \\ncan’t move against that kind of opposition without your \\nfather. He’s the only one who can stand against the Families. \\n\\n\\n1x9 \\n\\n\\n\\nHe has the political connexions they always need and he can \\nuse them for trading. If he wants to badly enough.* \\n\\nQemenxa said a little arrogantly for a man whose top button \\nman had recently betrayed him» *Sollozzo will never get near \\nthis house. Boss, you don’t have to worry about that.* \\n\\nSoimy looked at him thoughtfully for a moment. Then he \\nsaid to Tessio, *How about the hospital, your men got it \\ncovered?* \\n\\nFor the first time during the conference Tessio seemed to be \\nabsolutely sure of his ground. * Outside and inside,’ he said. \\n^ Right around the clock. The cops have it covered pretty good \\ntoo. Detectives ^t the bedroom doot waiting to question the \\nold man. That’s a laugh. The Don is still getting that stuff in \\nthe tubes, no food, so we don’t have to worry about the \\nkitchen, which would be something to worry about with those \\nTurks, they believe in poison. They can’t get at the Don, not \\nin any way.’ \\n\\nSonny tilted back in his chair. *It wouldn’t be me, they have \\nto do business with me, they need the Family machine.’ He \\ngrinned at Michael. wonder if it’s you? Maybe SoUozzo \\nfigures to snatch you and hold you for a hostage to make a \\ndeal.’ \\n\\nMichael thought ruefully, there goes my date with Kay. \\nSonny wouldn’t let him out of the house. But Hagen said im- \\npatiently, ‘No, he could have snatched Mike any time if he \\nwanted insurance. But everybody knows that Mike is not in \\nthe Family business. He’s a civilian and if Sollozzo snatches \\nhim, then he loses all the other New York Families. Even \\nthe Tattaglias would have to help hunt him down. No, it’s \\nsimple enough. Tomorrow we’ll get a representative from \\nall the F^amilies who’ll tell us we have to do business with the \\nTurk. That’s what he’s waiting for. That’s his ace in the \\nhole.’ \\n\\nMichael heaved a sigh of relief. ‘Good,’ he said. ‘I have to \\ngo into town tonight.’ \\n\\n‘Why?’ Sormy asked sharply. \\n\\nMichael grinned. ‘I figure I’ll drop in to the hospital and \\nvisit the old man, see Mom and Connie. And 1 got some other \\nthings to do.’ like the Don, Michael n^er told his real \\n\\n\\nlao \\n\\n\\n\\nbusiness and now he didn’t want to tell Sonny he was teeing \\nKay Adams. There was no reason not to tell him, it was just \\nhabit. \\n\\nThere was a loud murmur of voices in the kitchen. Ckmenza \\nwent out to sec what was happening. When he came back he \\nwas holding Luca Brasi’s bulletproof vest in his hands. \\nWrapped in the vest was a huge dead fish. \\n\\nQemenza said dryly, *Thc Turk has heard about his spy \\nPaulic Gatto.’ \\n\\nTessio said just as dryly, ‘And now we know about Luca \\nBrasi.’ \\n\\nSonny lit a dgai and took a shot of whisky. Michael, be- \\nwildered, said, ‘What the hell does that fish mean?’ It was \\nHagen the Irisher, the Consigiioriy who answered him. ‘The \\nfish means that Luca Brasi is sleeping on the bottom of the \\nocean,’ he said. ‘It’s an old Sicilian message.’ \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINE \\n\\nWhen Michael Corleone went into the city that night it was \\nwith a depressed spirit. He felt that he was being enmeshed in \\nthe Family business against his will and he resented Sonny \\nusing him even to answer the phone. He felt uncomfortable \\nbeing on the inside of the Family councils as if he could be \\nabsolutely trusted with such secrets as murder. And now, \\ngoing to see Kay, he felt guilty about her also. He had never \\nbeen completely honest with her about his family. He had told \\nher about them but always with little jokes and colourful anec- \\ndotes that made them seem more like adventurers in a Techni- \\ncolour movie than what they really were. And now his fi&ther \\nhad been shot down in the street and his eldest brother was \\nmaking plans for murder. That was putting it plainly and \\nsimply but that was never how he would tell it to Kzy, He had \\nalrouly said his father being shot was more like an ^accident’ \\nand that all the trouble was over. Hell, it looked like it was just \\nbeginning. Sonny and Tom were off-centre on this guy SoUoazo, \\n\\n\\n121 \\n\\n\\n\\nthey were still underrating him, even though Sonny was \\nsmart enough to see the danger. Michael tried to think what \\nthe Turk might have up his sleeve. He was obviously a bold \\nman, a clever man, a man of extraprdinary force. You had to \\nfigure him to come up with a real surprise. But then Sonny and \\nTom and Clemen 2 a and Tessio were all agreed that everything \\nwas under control and they all had more experience than he \\ndid. He was the ‘civilian\\' in this war, Michael thought wryly. \\nAnd they\\'d have to give him a hell of a lot better medals than \\nhe’d got in World War 11 to make him join this one. \\n\\nThinking this made him feel guilty about not feeling more \\nsympathy for his father. His own father shot full of holes and \\nyet in a curious way Michael, better than anyone else, under- \\nstood when Tom had said it was just busiiless, not personal. \\nThat his father had paid for the power he had wielded all \\nhis life, the respect he had extorted from all those around \\nhim. \\n\\nWhat Michael wanted was out, out of all this, to lead his \\nown life. But he couldn’t cut loose from the family until the crisis \\nwas over. He had to help in a civilian capacity. With sudden \\nclarity he realized that he was annoyed with the role assigned \\nto him, that of the privileged noncombatant, the excused con- \\nscientious objector. That was why the word ‘civilian’ kept \\npopping into his skull in such an irritating way. \\n\\n\\\\^en he got to the hotel, Kay was waiting for him in the \\nlobby. (A couple of Qemenza’s people had driven him into \\ntown and dropped him ofi on a nearby corner after making \\nsure they were not followed.) \\n\\nThey had dinner together and some drinks. ‘What time arc \\nyou going to visit your father?’ Kay asked. \\n\\nMichael looked at his watch. ‘Visiting hours end at eight- \\nthirty. I think I\\'ll go after everybody has left. They\\'ll let me \\nup. He has a private room and his own nurses so 1 can just sit \\nwith him for a while. I don’t think he can talk yet or even \\nknow if I’m there. But I have to show respect.’ \\n\\nKay said quietly, ‘I feel so sorry for your father, he seemed \\nlike such a nice man at the wedding. I can’t believe the things \\nthe papers are printing about him. I’m sure most of it’s not \\ntrue.’ \\n\\n\\n122 \\n\\n\\n\\nMichad said politely, don’t think so either.* He was sur- \\nprised to find himself so secretive with Kay. He loved her, he \\ntrusted her, but he would never tell her anything about his \\nfather or the Family. She was an outsider. \\n\\n‘What about you?’ Kay asked. ‘Arc you going to get mixed \\nup in this gang war the papers are talking about so gleefully?* \\n\\nMichael grinned, unbuttoned his jacket and held it wide \\nopen. ‘Look, no guns,’ he said. Kay laughed. \\n\\nIt was getting late and they went up to their room. She \\nmixed a drink for both of them and sat on his lap as they drank. \\nBeneath her dress she was all silk until his hand touched the \\nglowing skin of her thigh. They fell back on the bed together \\nand made love with all their clothes on, their mouths glued \\ntogether. When they were finished they lay very still, feeling \\nthe heat of their bodies burning through their garments. Kay \\nmurmured, ‘Is that what you soldiers call a quickie?’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Michael said. \\n\\n‘It’s not bad,’ Kay said in a judicious voice. \\n\\nThey do2ed off until Michael suddenly started up anxiously \\nand looked at his watch. ‘Damn,’ he said. ‘It’s nearly ten. I \\nhave to get down to the hospital.’ He went to the bathroom to \\nwash up and comb his hair. Kay came in after him and put her \\narms around his waist from behind. ‘When are we going to get \\nmarried ? ’ she asked. \\n\\n‘Whenever you say,’ Michael said. ‘As soon as this family \\nthing quiets down and my old man gets better. I think you’d \\nbetter explain things to your parents though.’ \\n\\n‘What should I explain?’ Kay said quietly. \\n\\nMichael ran the comb through his hair. ‘Just say that you’ve \\nmet a brave, handsome guy of Italian descent. Top marks at \\nDartmouth. Distinguished Service Cross during the war plus \\nthe Purple Heart. Honest. Hard-working. But his father is a \\nMafia chief who has to kill bad people, sometimes bribe high \\ngovernment officials and in his line of work gets shot full of \\nholes himself. But that has nothing to do with Iiis honest hard- \\nworking son. Do you think you can remember all that?’ \\n\\nKay let go his body and leaned against the door of the \\nbathroom. ‘Is he really?’ she said. ‘Does he really?’ She \\npaused. ‘Kill people?’ \\n\\n\\n\\nMidbad fin&hed oombiag hb btit. *I doa*t really know/ he \\n^id. ‘Nobcxly really knows. But 1 wouldo*i be surprised.’ \\n\\nBefore he went out the door she asked, * When will I see you \\nagain?’ \\n\\nMichael kissed her. ‘1 want you to go home and think \\nthings over in that little hick town of yours,* he said. ‘I don’t \\nwant you to get mixed up in this business in any way. After the \\nQiristmas holidays I’U be back at school and we’ll get together \\nup in Hanover. OK?’ \\n\\n‘OK,’ she said. She watched him go out the door, saw him \\nwave before he stepped into the elevator. She had never felt so \\nclose to him, never so much in love and if someone had \\ntold her she would not see Michael again until two years \\n|>assed, she would not have been able to bear the angui^ of \\n\\n\\nWhen Michael got out of the c b ifi front of the French \\nHospital he was surprised to see that the street was completely \\ndeserted. When he entered the hospital he was even more sur- \\nprised to find the lobby empty. Damn it, what the hell were \\nQemenza and Tessio doing? Sure, they never went to West \\nPoint but they knew enough about tacrics to have outposts. \\nA couple of their men should have been in the lobby at \\nleast. \\n\\nEven die latest visitors had departed, it was almost ten- \\nthirty at night. Michael was tense and alert now. He didn’t \\nbother to stop at the mformation desk, he already knew his \\nfather’s room number up on the fourth floor. He took the self- \\ns^icc elevator. Oddly enough nobody stopped him until he \\nreached the nurses’ station on the fourth floor. But he strode \\nright paist her query and on to his father’s room. There was no \\none outside the door. Where the hell were the two detectives \\nwho were supposed to be waiting around to guard and ques- \\ntion the old man? Where the hell were Tessio and Qemenza’s \\npeople? Could there be someone inside the room? But die \\ndoor was open. Michael went in. There was a figure in the bed \\nand by the December moonlight straining through the \\nwindow Michael could see his fiither’s face. Even now it was \\nimpassive, the chest heaved shallowly with his uneven breath. \\n\\n\\n114 \\n\\n\\n\\nIVibei faaog fitxm ffted gfdlowv betide ttie bed aod no \\noote. On the floor watt glass jarceoeiviQgtfaepoisotisemptM \\nfrom his stomach by other tubes. Michael stayed diere for a \\nfew moments to make sure his father was all right, then backed \\nout of the room. \\n\\nHe told the nurse, ^My name is Michael Corleone, 1 just \\nwant to sit with my father. What ha{>pened to the detectives \\nwho were supposed to be guarding him?’ \\n\\nThe nurse was a pretty young tfajng with a great deal of con- \\nfidence in the power of her office. *Oh, your fisther just had too \\nmany visitors, it interfered with the hospital service,’ she said. \\n* The police came and made them all leave about ten minutes \\nago. And then just five minutes ago 1 had to call the detectives \\nto the phone for an emergency alarm from their headquarters, \\nand then they left too. But don’t worry, 1 look in on your \\nfather often and 1 dm hear any sound from his room. That’s \\nwhy we leave the doors open.* \\n\\n\\'Thank you,’ Michael said. \\'1*11 sit with him for a little \\nwhile. OK?’ \\n\\nShe smiled at him. \\'Just for a little bit and then I’m aftaid \\nyou’ll have to leave. It’s the rules, you know.’ \\n\\nMichael went back into his father’s room. He took the \\nphone from its cradle and got the hospital operator to give \\nhim the house in Long Beach, the phone in ffie comer office \\nrcram. Sonny answered. Michael whispered, \\'Sonny, I’m \\ndown at the hospital, 1 came down late. Sonny, there’s nobody \\nhere. None of Tessio’s people. No detectives at the door. The \\nold tnan was completely unprotected.’ His voice was tremb- \\nling. \\n\\nThere was a long silence and then Sonny’s voice c^e, low \\nand impressed, \\'Ibis is Solloazo’s move you were talking \\nabout.’ \\n\\nMichael said, \\' That’s what 1 figured too. But how did he get \\nthe oops to cleu: everybody out and where did they go? W^ \\nhappened to Tessio’s men? Jesus Christ, has that bastard \\nS 0 U 0220 got the New York Police Department in his pocket \\ntoo?* \\n\\n\\'Take k easy, kid.’ Sonny’s voice was soodiing. \\'We got \\nhicky again wkh you going to visit the hospital so late. Stay in \\n\\n\\n\\nthe old man’s room. Lock the door from the inside. PU have \\nsome men there inside of fifreen minutes, soon as 1 make some \\ncalls. Just sit tight and don’t panic. OK, kid?’ \\n\\n‘1 won’t panic,’ Michael said. For the first time since it had \\nall started he felt a furious anger rising in him, a cold hatred \\nfor his father’s enemies. \\n\\nHe hung up the phone and rang the buzzer for the nurse. He \\ndecided to use his own judgement and disregard Sonny’s \\norders. When the nurse came in he said, ‘I don’t want you to \\nget frightened, but we have to move my father right away. To \\nanother room or another floor. Can you disconnect all these \\ntubes so we can wheel the bed out?’ \\n\\nThe nurse said, ‘That’s ridiculous. We have to get permis* \\nsion from the doctor.’ \\n\\nMichael spoke very quickly. ‘You’ve read about my father \\nin the papers. You’ve seen that there’s no one here tonight to \\nguard him. Now Pve just got word some men will come \\ninto the hospital to kill him. Please believe me and help me.’ \\nHe could be extraordinarily persuasive when he wanted to \\nbe. \\n\\nThe nurse said, ‘We don’t have to disconnect the tubes. We \\ncan wheel the stand with the bed.’ \\n\\n‘Do you have an empty room?’ Michael whispered. \\n\\n‘At the end of the haU,* the nurse said. \\n\\nIt was done in a matter of moments, very quickly and very \\nefficiently. Then Michael said to the nurse, ‘ Stay here with him \\nuntil help comes. If you’re outside at your station you might \\nget hurt.’ \\n\\nAt that moment he heard his father’s voice from the bed, \\nhoarse but full of strength, ‘Michael, is it you? What happened, \\nwhat is It?’ \\n\\nMichael leaned over the bed. He took his father’s hand in \\nhis. ‘It’s Mike,’ he said. ‘Don’t be afraid. Now listen, don’t \\nmake any noise at all, especially if somebody calls out your \\nname. Some people want to Idll you, understand? But I’m \\nhere so don’t be afraid.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone, still not fully conscious of what had hap- \\npened to him the day before, in terrible pain, yet smiled bene- \\nvolently on his youngest son, wanting to tell him, but it was \\n\\n126 \\n\\n\\n\\ntoo much effort, ‘Why should I be afraid now? Strange men \\nhave come to kill me ever since I was twelve years old.* \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN \\n\\n\\nThe hospital was small and private with just one entrance. \\nMichael looked through the window down into the street. \\nThere was a curved courtyard that had steps leading down \\ninto the street and the street was empty of cars. But whoever \\ncame into the hospital would have to come through that \\nentrance. He knew he didn’t have much time so he ran out of \\nthe room and down the four flights and through the wide \\ndoors of the ground floor entrance. Off to the side he saw the \\nambulance yard and there was no car there, no ambulances \\ncither. \\n\\nMichael stood on the sidewalk outside the hospital and lit a \\ncigarette. He unbuttoned his coat and stood in light of a \\nlamp-post so that his features could be seen. A young man was \\nwalking swiftly down from Ninth Avenue, a pacl^ge under \\nhis arm. The young man wore a combat jacket and had a heavy \\nshock of black hair. His face was familiar when he came under \\nthe lamplight but Michael could not place it. But the young \\nman stopped in front of him and put out his hand, saying in a \\nheavy Italian accent, ‘Don Michael, do you remember me? \\nEnzo, the baker’s helper to Nazorine the Paniterra; his son-in- \\nlaw. Your father saved my life by getting the government to \\nlet me stay in America.* \\n\\nMichael shook his hand. He remembered him now. \\n\\nEnzo went on, ‘I’ve come to pay my respects to your father. \\nWill they let me into the hospital so late?’ \\n\\nMichael smiled and shook his head. ‘No, but thanks any- \\nway. I’ll tell the Don you came.’ A car came roaring down the \\nstreet and Michael was instantly alert. He said to Enzo, ‘Leave \\nhere quickly. There may be trouble. You don’t want to get \\ninvolved with the police.’ \\n\\nHe saw the look of fear on the young Italian’s face. Trouble \\n\\n\\n\\nwith the police might mean being deported or refusal of \\ncitizenship. But the young man stood hst. He whispered in \\nItalian, ‘If there’s trouble I’ll stay to help. I owe it to the \\nGodfather.’ \\n\\nMichael was touched. He was about to tell the young man \\nto go away again, but then he thought, why not let him stay? \\nTwo men in front of the hospital might scare off any of Sol- \\nlozzo’s crew sent to do a job. One man almost certainly \\nwould not. He gave Enzo a cigarette and lit it for him. They \\nboth stood under the lamp-post in the cold December night. \\nThe yellow panes of the hospital, bisected by the greens of \\nQiristmas decorations, twinkled down on them. They had \\nalmost finished their cigarettes when a long low black car \\nturned into 30th Street from Ninth Avenue and cruised to- \\nwards them, very close to the kerb. It almost stopped. Michael \\npeered to see the faces inside, his body flinching involun- \\ntarily. The car seemed about to stop, then speeded forward. \\nSomebody had recognized him. Michael gave Enzo another \\ncigarette and noticed that the baker’s hands were shaking. To \\nhis surprise his own hands were steady. \\n\\nThey stayed in the street smoking for what was no more \\nthan ten minutes when suddenly the night air was split by a \\npolice siren. A patrol car made a screaming turn from Ninth \\nAvenue and pulled up in front of the hospital. Two more \\nsquad cars followed right behind it. Suddenly the hospital \\nentrance-way was flooded with uniformed police and de- \\ntectives. Michael heaved a sigh of relief. Good old Sonny must \\nhave got through right away. He moved forward to meet \\nthem. \\n\\nTwo huge, burly policemen grabbed his arms. Another \\nfrisked him. A massive police captain, gold braid on his cap, \\ncame up the steps, his men parting respectfully to leave a path. \\nHe was a vigorous man for his girth and despite the white hair \\nthat peeked out of his cap. His face was beefy red. He came up \\nto Michael and said harshly, *I thought 1 got all you guinea \\nhoods locked up. Who the hell are you and what are you doing \\nhere?’ \\n\\nOne of the cops standing beside Michael 8aid» ‘He’s dean, \\nGiptain.’ \\n\\n\\nlaS \\n\\n\\n\\nMichael didn’t answer. He was stadying this police captain, \\ncoldly searching his fiice, the metallic blue eyes. A detective in \\nplain clothes said, ’That’s Michael Corleone, the Don’s son.’ \\nMichael said quietly, ’What happened to the detectives who \\nwere supposed to be guarding my fiather? Who pulled them \\no£F that detail?’ \\n\\nThe police captain was choleric with rage. ‘You fucking \\nhood, who the hell are you to tell me my business? I pulled \\nthem off. 1 don’t give a shit how many dago gangsters kill each \\nother. If it was up to me, I wouldn’t lift a finger to keep your \\nold man from getting knocked off. Now get the hell out of \\nhere. Get out of this street, you punk, and stay out of this \\nhospital when it’s not visiting hours.’ \\n\\nMichael was still studying him intently. He was not angry at \\nwhat this police captain was saying. His mind was racing \\nfuriously. Was it possible that SoUozzo had been in that first \\ncar and had seen him standing in front of the hospital? Was it \\npossible that SoUozzo had then called this captain and said, \\n’How come the Corleones* men are still around the hospital \\nwhen I paid you to lock them up?’ Was it possible that aU had \\nbeen carefully plaimed as Sonny had said? Everything fitted in. \\nSdll cool, he said to the captain, ’I’m not leaving this hospital \\nuntil you put guards around my father’s room.’ \\n\\nThe captain didn’t bother answering. He said to the detec- \\ntive standing beside him, ’Phil, lock this punk up.’ \\n\\nThe detective said hesitantly, ’The kid is clean. Captain. \\nHe’s a war\\' hero and he’s never been mixed up in the rackets. \\nThe papers could make a sdnk.’ \\n\\nT^c captain started to turn on the detective, his face red \\nwith fiiry. He roared out, ’Goddamn it, I said lock him up.’ \\n\\nMichael, still thinking clearly, not angry, said with de- \\nliberate malice, ’How much is the Turk paying you to set my \\nfather up. Captain?’ \\n\\nThe police captain turned to him. He said to the two burly \\npatrolmen, ’Hold him.’ Michael felt his arms pinned to his \\nsides. He saw the captain’s massive fist arching towards his \\nface. He tried to weave away but the fist caught him high on \\nthe cheekbone. A grenade exploded in his skull. His mouth \\nfitter! with blood and small hard bones that he realized were his \\n\\n\\n119 \\n\\n\\n\\nteeth. He could feel the side of his head puff up as if it \\nwere filling with air. His legs were weighdess and he would \\nhave fidlen if the two policemen had not held him up. But \\nhe was still conscious. The plainclothes detective had stepped \\nin front of him to keep the captain from hitting Um \\nagain and was saying, ‘Jesus Christ, Captain, you really hurt \\nhim.’ \\n\\nThe captain said loudly, ‘I didn’t touch him. He attacked \\nme and he fell. Do you understand that? He resisted arrest.’ \\n\\nThrough a red haze Michael could see more cars pulling up \\nto the kerb. Men were getting out. One of them he recognized \\nas Clemenza’s lawyer, who was now speaking to the police \\ncaptain, suavely and surely. ‘The Corleone Family has hired a \\nfirm of private detectives to guard Mr Corleone. These men \\nwith me are licensed to carry firearms. Captain. If you arrest \\nthem, you’ll have to appear before a judge in the morning and \\ntell him why.* \\n\\nThe lawyer glanced at Michael. ‘Do you want to prefer \\ncharges against whoever did this to you?’ he asked. \\n\\nMichael had trouble talking. His jaws wouldn’t come to- \\ngether but he managed to mumble. *1 slipped,’ he said. *I \\nslipped and fell.’ He saw the captain give him a triumphant \\nglance and he tried to answer that glance with a smile. At all \\ncosts he wanted to hide the delicious icy chilliness that con- \\ntrolled his brain, the surge of wintry cold hatred that pervaded \\nhis body. He wanted to give no warning to anyone in this \\nworld as to how he felt at this moment. As the Don would not. \\nThen he felt himself carried into the hospital and he lost con- \\nsciousness. \\n\\nWl^en he woke up in the morning he found that his jaw had \\nbeen wired together and that four of his teeth along the left \\nside of his mouth were missing. Hagen was sitting beside his \\nbed. \\n\\n‘Did they drug me up?’ Michael asked. \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Hagen said. ‘They had to dig some bone. fragments \\nout of your gums and they figured it would be too painful. \\nBesides you were practically out anyway.’ \\n\\n\\'Is there anything ebe wrong with me?’ Michael asked. \\n\\n\\n130 \\n\\n\\n\\n*No/ Hagen said. * Sonny wants you out at the Long Beach \\nhouse. Think you can make it?’ \\n\\n‘Sure/ Michael said. ‘Is the Don all right?’ \\n\\nHagen flushed. ‘I think weVe solved the problem now. We \\nhave a Arm of private detectives and we have the whole area \\nloaded. 1*11 tell you mote when we get in the car.* \\n\\nClemenza was driving, Michael and Hagen sat in the back. \\nMichael’s head throbbed. ‘So what the hell really happened \\nlast night, did you guys ever And out ? ’ \\n\\nHagen spoke quietly. ‘Sonny has an inside man, that \\nDetective Phillips who tried to protect you. He gave us the \\nscoop. The police captain, McQuskey, is a guy who’s been on \\nthe take very heavy ever since he’s been a patrolman. Our \\nFamily has paid him quite a bit. And he’s greedy and untrust- \\nworthy to do business with. But Sollo 2 : 2 o must have paid him \\na big price. McQuskey had all Tessio’s men around and in the \\nhospital arrested right after visiting hours. It didn’t help that \\nsome of them were carrying guns. Then McQuskey pulled the \\nofficial guard detectives ofl the Don’s door. Claimed he needed \\nthem and that some other cops were supposed to go over and \\ntake their place but they got their assignments bollixed. \\nBaloney. He was paid ofl to set the Don up. And Phillips said \\nhe’s the kind of guy who’ll try it again. SoUozzo must have \\ngiven him a fortune for openers and promised him the moon \\nto come.’ \\n\\n‘Was triy getting hurt in the papers?’ \\n\\n‘No,’ Hagen said. ‘We kept that quiet. Nobody wants that \\nknown. Not the cops. Not us.’ \\n\\n‘Good,’ Michael said. ‘Did that boy Enxo get away?’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Hagen said. ‘He was smarter than you. When the \\ncops came be disappeared. He claims he stuck with you while \\nSollozzo’s car went by. Is that true?* \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Michael said. ‘He’s a good kid.’ \\n\\n‘He’ll be taken care of,’ Hagen said. ‘You feeling OK?’ His \\nface was concerned. ‘You look lousy.’ \\n\\n‘I’m OK,’ Michael said. ‘What was that police captain’s \\nname?’ \\n\\n‘McQuskey,^ Hagen said. ‘By the way, it might make you \\nfed better to know that the Corleone Family Ansdly got up \\n\\n\\n\\non the scoreboard. Bruno Tattaglia, four o*clock this morn- \\ning.’ \\n\\nMichael sat up. ‘ How come? T thought we were supposed to \\nsit tight.’ \\n\\nHagen shrugged. ‘After what happened at the hospital \\nSonny got hard. The button men are out all over New York \\nand New Jersey. We made the list last night. Fm trying to hold \\nSonny in, Mike. Maybe you can talk to him. This whole \\nbusiness can still be settled without a major war.’ \\n\\n‘Fll talk to him,’ Michael said. ‘Is there a conference this \\nmorning?’ \\n\\n‘ Yeah,* Hagen said. ‘ S0II0220 finally got in touch and wants \\nto sit down with us. A negotiator is arranging the details. \\nThat means we win. Sollo220 knows he’s lost and he wants to \\nget out with his life.’ Hagen paused. ‘Maybe he thought we \\nwere soft, ready to be taken, because we didn’t strike back. \\nNow with one of the Tattaglia sons dead he knows we mean \\nbusiness. He really took an awful gamble bucking the Don. \\nBy the way, we got the confirmation on Luca. They killed him \\nthe night before they shot your father. In Bruno’s nightclub. \\nImagine that?’ \\n\\nMichael said, ‘No wonder they caught him off guard.’ \\n\\nAt the houses in Long Beach the entrance to the mall was \\nblocked by a long black car parked across its mouth. Two men \\nleaned against the hood of the car. The two houses on each \\nside, Michael noticed, had opened windows on their upper \\nfloors. Christ, Sonny must really mean business. \\n\\nClemen2a parked the car outside the mall and they walked \\ninside it. The two guards were Clemen2a’s men and he gave \\nthem a frown of greeting that served aj a salute. The men \\nnodded their heads in acknowledgement. There were no \\nsmiles, no greetings. Clemcnza led Hagen and Michael \\nCorleone into the house. \\n\\nTine door was opened by another guard before they rang. \\nHe had obviously been watching from a window. They went \\nto the corner office and found Sonny and Tessip waiting for \\nthem. Sonny came to Michael, took his younger brother’s head \\nin his hands and said kiddingly, ‘Beautiful. Beautiful.* Michael \\n\\n\\n\\nknocked bis hands away, and went to the desk and poured \\nhimself some Scotch, hoping it would dull the ache in his \\nwired }aw. \\n\\nThe five of them sat around the room but the atmosphere \\nwas different than their earlier meetings. Sonny was gayer, \\nmore cheerful, and Michael realized w^t that gaiety meant. \\nThere were no longer any doubts in his older brother’s mind. \\nHe was committed and nothing would sway him. The attempt \\nby Sollo^o the night before was the fiiml straw. There could \\nno longer be any question of a truce. \\n\\n‘We got a call from the negotiator while you were gone,’ \\nSonny said to Hagen. ‘ The Turk wants a meeting now.’ Sonny \\nlaughed. ‘ The balls on that son of a bitch,* he said admiringly. \\n‘After he craps out last night he wants a meeting today or the \\nnext day. Meanwhile we’re supposed just to lay back and take \\neverything he dishes out. What fucking nerve.’ \\n\\nTom asked cautiously, ‘ What did you answer ? ’ \\n\\nSonny grinned. ‘I said sure, why not? Any time he says, J’m \\nin no hurry. I’ve got a hundred button men out on the street \\ntwenty-four hours a day. If Sollozzo shows one hair on his \\nasshole he’s dead. Let them take all the time they want.’ \\n\\nHagen said, ‘Was there a definite proposal?’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Sonny said. ‘He wants vis to send Mike to meet him \\nto hear his proposition. The negotiator guarantees Mike’s \\nsafety. Sollozzo doesn’t ask us to guarantee his safety, he \\nknows he can’t ask that. No point. So the meeting will be \\narranged on his side. His people will pick Mike up and take \\nMike to the meeting place. Mike will listen to Sollozzo and \\nthen they’ll turn him loose. But the meeting place is secret. The \\npromise is the deal will be so good we can’t turn it down.’ \\n\\nHagen asked, ‘ What about the Tattaglias ? What will they do \\nabout Bruno?’ \\n\\n‘That’s part of the deal. The negotiator says the Tattaglia \\nFamily has agreed to go along with Sollozzo. They’ll forget \\nabout Bruno Tattaglia. He pays for what they did to my \\nfather. One cancels out the other.’ Sonny laughed again. ‘The \\nnervy bastards.’ \\n\\nHagen said cautiously, ‘We should hear what they have to \\nsay.* \\n\\n\\nX35 \\n\\n\\n\\nSonny shook his head from side to side. \\'No, no, Consiglwri^ \\nnot this time.’ His voice held a faint trace of Italian accent. He \\nwas consciously mocking his father just to kid around. \\'No \\nmore meetings. No more discussions. No more Sollo22o tricks. \\nWhen the negotiator gets in touch with us again for our \\nanswer I want you to give him one message. I want Sollozzo. \\nIf not, it’s all-out war. We’ll go to the mattresses and we’ll put \\nall the button men out on the street. Business will just have to \\nsuffer.’ \\n\\n‘ The other Families won’t stand for an all-out war,’ Hagen \\nsaid. ‘It puts too much heat on everybody.* \\n\\nSonny shrugged. ‘They have a simple solution. Give me \\nSollozzo. Or fight the Corleone Family.* Sonny paused, then \\nsaid roughly, ‘No more advice on how to patch it up, Tom. \\nThe decision is made. Your job is to help me win. Under- \\nstand ? ’ \\n\\nHagen bowed his head. He was deep in thought for a \\nmoment. Then he said, ‘I spoke to your contact in the poUce \\nstation. He says that Captain McQuskey is definitely on Sol- \\nlozzo’s payroll and for big money. Not only that, but \\nMcCluskey is going to get a piece of the drug operation. \\nMcCluskey has agreed to be Sollozzo’s bodyguard. The Turk \\ndoesn’t poke his nose out of his hole without McQuskey. \\nWhen he meets Mike for the conference, McCluskey will be \\nsitting beside him. In civilian clothes but carrying his gun. \\nNow what you have to understand. Sonny, is that while Sol- \\nlozzo is guarded like this, he’s invulnerable. Nobody has ever \\ngunned down a New York police captain and got away \\nwith it. The heat in this town would be unbearable what with \\nthe newspapers, the whole police department, the churches, \\neverything. That would be disastrous. The Families would be \\nafter you. The Corleone Family would become outcasts. Even \\nthe old man’s political protection would run for cover. So take \\nthat into consideration.’ \\n\\nSonny shrugged. ‘McQuskey can’t stay with the Turk for \\never. We’ll wait.’ \\n\\nTessio and Qemenza were puffing on their cigars uneasily, \\nnot daring to speak, but sweating. It would be their skins that \\nwould go on the line if the wrong decision was made. \\n\\n\\n134 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\' Michael spoke for the first time. He asked Hagen, *Can the \\nold man be moved out of the hospital on to the mall here?* \\nHagen shook his head. ‘That’s the first thing I asked. Im- \\npossible. He’s in very bad shape. He’ll pull through but he \\nneeds all kinds of attention, maybe some more surgery. Im- \\npossible.’ \\n\\n‘Then you have to get SoUozzo right away,’ Michael said. \\n‘We can’t wait. The guy is too dangerous. He’ll come up with \\nsome new idea. Remember, the key is still that he gets rid of \\nthe old man. He knows that. OK, he knows that now it’s very \\ntough so he’s willing to take defeat for his Ufe. But if he’s \\ngoing to get killed anyway, he’ll have another crack at the \\nDon. ^nd with that police captain helping him who knows \\nwhat the hell might happen. We can’t take that chance. We \\nhave to get S0II0220 right away.* \\n\\nSonny was scratching his chin thoughtfully. ‘You’re right, \\nkid,’ he said. ‘You got right to the old nuts. We can’t let \\nSoUozzo get another crack at the old man.’ \\n\\nHagen said quietly, ‘What about Captain McCluskey?’* \\nSonny turned to Michael with an odd little smile. ‘Yeah, \\nkid, what about that tough police captain?’ \\n\\nMichael said slowly, ‘OK, it’s an eictreme. But there are \\ntimes when the most extreme measures are justified. Let’s \\nthink now that we have to kill McCluskey. The way to do it \\nwould be to have him heavily implicated so that it’s not an \\nhonest police captain doing his duty but a crooked police \\nofiBcial mixed up in the rackets who got what was coming to \\nhim, like any crook. We have newspaper people on our pay- \\nroU we can give that story to with enough proof so that they \\ncan back it up. That should take some of the heat off. How \\ndoes that sound?’ Michael looked around defereadaUy to the \\nothers. Tessio and Oemenza had gloomy faces and reused to \\nspeak. Sonny said with the same odd smile, ‘Go on, kid, \\nyou’re doing great. Out of the mouths of infants, as the Don \\nalways used to say. Go ahead, Mike, teU us more.* \\n\\nHagen was smiling too a little and averting his head. \\nMich^ flushed. ‘WeU, they want me to go to a conference \\nwith SoUozzo. It wiU be me, SoUozzo and McQuskey aU on \\nour own. Set up the meeting for two days from now, ^en get \\n\\n\\n\\nour informers to find out where the meeting will be held. \\nInsist that it has to be a public place, that I’m not going to let \\nthem take me into any apartments or houses. Let it be a \\nrestaurant or a bar at the height of the dinnet hour, something \\nlike that, so that I’ll feel safe. They’ll feel safe too. Even Sol- \\nlozzo won’t figure that we’ll dare to gun the captain. They’ll \\nfrisk me when 1 meet them so I’ll have to be clean then, but \\nfigure out a way you can get a weapon to me while I’m meet- \\ning them. Then I’ll take both of them.’ \\n\\nAll fouz heads turned and stared at him. Clemenza and \\nTcssio were gravely astonished. Hagen looked a little sad but \\nnot surprised. He started to speak and thought better of it. But \\nSonny, his heavy Cupid’s face twitching with mirth, suddenly \\nbroke out in loud roars of laughter. It was deep belly laughter, \\nnot faking. He was really breaking up. He pointed a finger at \\nMichael, trying to speak through gasps of mirth. ‘You, the \\nhigh-class college kid, you never wanted to get mixed up in \\nthe Family business. Now you wanta kill a police captain and \\nthe Turk just because you got your face smashed by Mc- \\nCluskey. You’re taking it personal, it’s just business and you’re \\ntaking it personal. You wanta kill these two guys just because \\nyou got slapped in the face. It was all a lot of crap. All these \\nyears it was just a lot of crap.’ \\n\\nClemenza and Tessio, completely misunderstanding, think- \\ning that Sonny was laughing at his young brother’s bravado \\nfor making such an ofier, were also smiling broadly and a little \\npatronizingly at Michael. Only Hagen warily kept his face \\nimpassive. \\n\\nMichael looked around at all of them, then stared at Sonny, \\nwho still couldn’t stop laughing. ‘ You*// take both of them?’ \\nSonny said. ‘Hey, kid, they won’t give you medals, they put \\nyou in the electric chair. You know that? This is no hero \\nbusiness, kid, you don’t shoot people from a mile away. You \\nshoot when you see the whites of their eyes like we got taught \\nin school, remember? You gotta stand right next to them and \\nblow their heads o£F and their brains get all over your nice \\nIvy League suit. How about that, kid, you wanta do that just \\nbecause some dumb cop slapped you around?’ He was still \\nlaughing. \\n\\n156 \\n\\n\\n\\nMichael stood up. * Yoa*d better stop laughing/ he said. The \\nchange in him was so extraordinary that the smiles vanished \\nftom the hccB of Qemenxa and Tessio. Michael was not tall or \\nheavily built but his presence seemed to radiate danger. In that \\nmoment he was a reincarnation of Don Corleone himself. His \\neyes had gone a pale tan amd his face was bleached of colour. \\nHe seemed at any moment about to fling himself on his older \\nand stronger brother. There was no doubt that if he had had a \\nweapon in his hands Sonny would have been in danger. Sonny \\nstopped laughing, and Michael said to him in a cold deadly \\nvoice, ‘Dbn’t you think I can do it, you son of a bitch?\\' \\n\\nSonny had got over his laughing fit. ‘I know you can do it,\\' \\nhe said. ‘I wasn’t laughing at what you said. I was just laugh- \\ning at how funny things turn out. I always said you were the \\ntoughest one in the Family, tougher th^ the Don himself. \\nYou were the only one who could stand off the old man. 1 \\nremember you when you were a kid. What a temper you had \\nthen. Hell, you even used to fight me and I was a lot older \\nthan you. And Freddie had to beat ,the shit out of you at least \\nonce a week. And now Sollozzo has you figured for the soft \\ntouch in the Family because you let McQuskey hit you without \\nfighting back and you wouldn’t get mixed up in the Family \\nfights. He figures he got nothing to worry al^ut if he meets \\nyou head to head. And McCluskey too, he’s got you figured \\nfor a yellow guinea.’ Sonny paused and then said softly, \\'But \\nyou’re a Corleone after all, you son of a bitch. Aind 1 was the \\nonly one who knew it. I’ve been sitting here waiting for the \\nlast three days, ever since the old man got shot, waiting for \\nyou to crack out of that Ivy League, war hero bullshit character \\nyou’ve been wearing. I’ve been waiting for you to become my \\nright arm so we can kill those fucks that are trying to destroy \\nour father and our Family. And all it took was a sock on the \\njaw. How do you like that?\\' Sonny made a comical gesture, a \\npunch, and repeated, \\'How do you like that?’ \\n\\nThe tension had relaxed in the room. Mike shook his head. \\n\\'Sonny, I’fn doing it because it’s the only thing to do. I can’t \\ngive Siollozzo another crack at the old man. 1 seem to be the \\nonly one who can get close enough to him. And I figured it \\nout. I don\\'t think you can get anybody else to knock oS a \\n\\n\\n*57 \\n\\n\\n\\npolice captain. Maybe you would do it» Sonny, but you have a \\nwife and kids and you have to run the Family business until \\nthe old man is in shape. So that leaves me and Freddie. Freddie \\nis in shock and out of action. Finally that leaves just me. It’s all \\nlogic. The sock on the jaw had nothing to do with it.* \\n\\nSonny came over and embraced him. ‘ I don’t give a damn \\nwhat your reasons are, just so long as you’re with us now. And \\nm tell you another thing, you’re right all the way, Tom, \\nwhat’s your say?* \\n\\nHagen shrugged. \\'The reasoning is solid. What makes it so \\nis that I don’t think the Turk is sincere about a deal. I think \\nhe’ll still try tq get at the Don. Anyway on his past perfor- \\nmance that’s how we have to figure him. So we try to get \\nSollozzo. We get him even if we have to get the police captain. \\nBut whoever does the job is going to get an awful lot of heat. \\nDoes it have to be Mike?’ \\n\\nSonny said softly, ‘ I could do it.* \\n\\nHagen shook his head impatiently. ‘SoHozzo wouldn’t let \\nyou get within a mile of him if he had ten police captains. And \\nbesides you’re the acting head of the Family. You can’t be \\nrisked.’ Hagen paused and said to Clcmenza and Tessio, \\'Do \\neither one of you have a top button man, someone really \\nspexial, who would take on this job? He wouldn’t have to \\nworry about money for the rest of his life.’ \\n\\nQemenza spoke first. \\'Nobody that Sollozzo wouldn’t \\nknow, he’d catch on right away. He’d catch on if me or Tessio \\nwent too.* \\n\\nHagen said, \\'What about somebody really tough who hasn’t \\nmade his rep yet, a good rookie?’ \\n\\nBoth caporegtmes shook their heads. Tessio smiled to take the \\nsting out of liis words and said, \\'Hiat’s like bringing a guy up \\nfrom the minors to pitch the World Scries.’ \\n\\nSonny broke in curtly, \\'It has to be Mike. For a million \\ndifferent reasons. Most important they got him down as faggy. \\nAnd he can do the job, I guarantee that, and that’s important \\nbecause this is the only shot we’ll get at that sneaky bastard \\nTurk. So now we have to figure out the best way to back him \\nup. Tom, Qemenza, Tessio, find out where Sollozzo will take \\nhim for the conference, I don’t care how much it costs. When \\n\\n138 \\n\\n\\n\\nwe find that out we can figute out how we can get a weapon \\ninto hia hands. Qemenaa, I want you to get him a really safe*’ \\ngun out of your collection, the ** coldest” one you got. Im- \\npossible to trace. Try to make it short barrel with a lot of blast- \\ning power. It doesn’t have to be accurate. He’ll be right on top \\nof them when he uses it. Mike, as soon as you’ve used the gun, \\ndrop it on the floor. Don’t be caught with it on you. Qemenza^ \\ntape the barrel and the trigger with that special stuil you got so \\nhe won’t leave prints. Remember, Mike, we can square every- \\nthing, witnesses, and so forth, but if they catch you with the \\ngun on you we can’t square that. We’ll have transportation and \\nprotection and then we’ll make you disappear for a nice long \\nvacation until the heat wears oflT. You’ll be gone a long time, \\nMike, but 1 don’t want you saying goodbye to your girlfriend \\nor even calling her. After it’s all over and you’re out of the \\ncountry I’ll send her word that you’re OK. Those are orders/ \\nSonny smiled at his brother. ‘Now stick with Qemenaa and \\nget used to handling the gun he picks out for you. Maybe even \\npractise a little. We’ll take care of everything else. Everything. \\nOK, kid?’ \\n\\nAgain Michael Corleone felt that delicious refreshing chil- \\nliness all over his body. He said to his brother, ‘You didn’t \\nhave to give me that crap about not talking to my girlfrieod \\nabout something like this. What the hell did you think 1 was \\ngoing to do, call her up to say goodbye?’ \\n\\nSonny said hastily, ‘OK, but you’re still a rookie so I spell \\nthings out. Forget it.’ \\n\\nMichael said with a grin, ‘What the hell do you mean, a \\nrookie? I listened to the old man just as hard as you did. How \\ndo you think I got so smart?’ They both laughed. \\n\\nHagen poured drinks for everyone. He looked a little glum. \\nThe statesman forced to go to war, the lawyer forced to go to \\nlaw. ‘ Well, anyway now we know what we’re going to do,’ he \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN \\n\\n\\nCaptain Mark McCluskey sat in his office fingering three \\nenvelopes bulging with betting slips^ He was frowning and \\nwishing he could decode the notations on the slips. It was very \\nimportant that he do so. The envelopes were the betting slips \\nthat his raiding parties had picked up when they had hit one of \\nthe Corleone Family bookmakers the night before. Now the \\nbookmaker would have to buy back the slips so that players \\ncouldn’t claim winners and wipe him out. \\n\\nIt was very important for Captain McCluskey to decode the \\nslips because he didn’t want to get cheated when he sold the \\nslips back to the bookmaker. If there was fifty grand worth of \\naction, then maybe h^ could sell it back for five grand. But if \\nthere were a lot of iieavy bets and the slips represented a \\nhundred grand or maybe even two hundred grand, then the \\nprice should be considerably higher. McCluskey fiddled with \\nthe envelopes and then decided to let the bookie sweat a little \\nbit and make the first offer. That might tip ofi what the real \\nprice should be. \\n\\nMcCluskey looked at the station house clock on the wall of \\nhis office. It was time for him to pick up that greasy Turk, \\nSoUozzo, and take him to wherever he was going to meet the \\nCorleone Family. McCluskey went over to his wall locker and \\nstarted to change into his civilian clothes. When be was \\nfinished he called his wife and told her he would not be home \\nfor sapper that night, that he would be out on the job. He \\nnever confided in his wife on anything. She thought they lived \\nthe way they did on his policeman’s salary. McCluskey grunted \\nwith amusement. His mother had thought the same thing but \\nhe had learned early, flis father had shown him the ropes. \\n\\nHis father had been a police sergeant, and every week father \\nand son had walked though the precinct and McQuskey \\nSenior had introduced his six-year-old son to the storekeepers, \\nsaying, ‘And this is my little boy.* \\n\\nThe storekeepers would shake his hand and compliment \\n\\n140 \\n\\n\\n\\nhim extravagantly and dng open their cash registers to give the \\nlittle boy a gift of five or ten dollars. At the end of the day, \\nlittle Mark McCuskey would have all the pockets of his suit \\nstuffed with paper money, would feel so proud that his fiither*s \\nfriends liked him well enough to give him a present every \\nmonth they saw him. Of course his father put the money in the \\nbank for him, for his college education, and little Mark got at \\nmost a fifty-ccnt piece for himself. \\n\\nThen when Mark got home and his policemen uncles asked \\nhim what he wanted to be when he grew up and he would lisp \\nchildishly, ‘A policeman,* they would all laugh uproariously. \\nAnd of course later on, though his father wanted him to go to \\ncollege first, he went right from high school to studying for \\nthe police force. \\n\\nHe had been a good cop, a brave cop. The tough young \\npunks terrorizing street corners fled ^hen he approached and \\nfinally vanished from his beat altog ^ther. He was a very tough \\ncop and a very fair one. He never took his son around to ^e \\nstorekeepers to collect his money presents for ignoring gar- \\nbage violations and parking violations; he took the money \\ndirectly into his own hand, direct because he felt he earned it. \\nHe never ducked into a movie house or goofed off into res- \\ntaurants when he was on foot patrol as some of the other cops \\ndid, especially on winter nights^ He always made his rounds. \\nHe gave his stores a lot of protection, a lot of service. When \\nwinos and drunks filtered up from the Bowery to panhandle \\non his beat he got rid of them so roughly that they never came \\nback. The tradespeople in his precinct appreciated it. And they \\nshowed their appreciation. \\n\\nHe also obeyed the system. The bookies in ^ his prednet \\nknew he would never make trouble to get an extra payoff for \\nhimself, that he was content for his share of the station house \\nbag. His name was on the li^t with the others and he never \\ntried to make extras. He was a fair cop who took only clean \\ngraft and his rise in the police department was steady if not \\nspectacular. \\n\\nDuring this time he was raising a large family of four sons, \\nnone of whom became policemen. They all w6nt to Fordham \\nUniversity and since by that time Mark McOuskey was rising \\n\\n\\n141 \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom sergeant to lieutenant and finally to captain, they lacked \\nfor nothing. It was at this time that McQuskey got the reputa- \\ntion for being a hard bargainer. The bookmakers in his district \\npaid more protection money than the bookmakers in any other \\npart of the city, but maybe that was because of the expense of \\nputting four boys through coUege. \\n\\nMcQuskey himself felt there was nothing wrong with clean \\ngraft. Why the hell should his kids go to CCNY oi a cheap \\nSouthern college just because the Police Department didn’t \\npay its people enough money to live on and take care of their \\nfamilies properly with? He protected all these people with his \\nlife and his record showed his dtations for gun duels with \\nstick-up men on his beat, strong-arm protection guys, would- \\nb^ pimps. He had hammered them into the ground. He had \\njtept his little corner of the city safe for ordinary people and he \\nsure as hell was entided to more than his lousy one C note a \\nweek. But he wasn’t indignant about his low pay, he under- \\nstood that everybody had to take care of themselves. \\n\\nBruno Tattaglia was an old friend of his. Bruno had gone to \\nFordham with one of his sons and then Bruno had opened his \\nnightclub and whenever the McQuskey family spent an in- \\nfrequent night on the town, they could enjoy the cabaret with \\nliquor and dinner - on the house. On New Year’s Eve they \\nreceived engraved invitations to be guests of the management \\nand always received one of the best tables. Bruno always nuide \\nsure they were introduced to the celebrities who performed in \\nhis club, some of them famous singers and Holl3rwood stars. \\nOf course sometimes he asked a little favour, like getting an \\nemployee with a record cleared for a cabaret work licence, \\nusuaUy a pretty girl with a police dossier as a hustler or roller. \\nMcQuskey would be glad to oblige. \\n\\nMcQuskey made it a policy never to show that he under- \\nstood what other people were up to. When Sollozzo had \\napproached him with the proposition to leave old man Cor^ \\nleone uncovered in the hospital, McQuskey didn’t ask why. \\nHe asked price. When Sollozzo said ten grand, McQuskey \\nknew why. He did not hesitate. Q>rleone was one of the \\nbiggest b^fia men in the country with more political connex- \\nions than Gqxme had ever had. Whoever knocked him ofi \\n\\n\\n\\nwould be doing the country a big favour. McCluskey took the \\nmoney in advance and did the job. When he received a call \\nfrom Sollozzo that there were still two of Corleone’s men in \\nfront of the hospital he had flown into a rage. He had locked \\nup all of Tessio *8 men, he had pulled the detective guards off \\nthe door of Coileone’s hospital room. And now, being a man \\nof principle, he would have to give back the ten grand, money \\nbe had already earmarked to insure the education of his grand* \\nchildren. It was in that rage that he had gone to the hospital \\nand struck Michael Corleone. \\n\\nBut it had all worked out for the best. He had met with \\nS0II0220 in the Tattaglia nightclub and they had made an even \\nbetter deal. Again McCluskey didn’t ask questions, since he \\nknew all the answers. He just made sure of his ptice. It never \\noccurred to him that he himself could be in any danger. That \\nanyone would consider even for a moment killing a New York \\nQty police captain was too fantastic. The toughest hood in the \\nMadBa had to stand still if the lowliest patrolman decided to \\nslap him arotind. There was absolutely no percentage in \\nkilling cops. Because then all of a sudden a lot of hoods were \\nkilled resisting arrest or escaping the scene of a crime, and who \\nthe hell was going to do anything about that ? \\n\\nMcQuskey sighed and got ready to leave the station bouse. \\nProblems, always problems. His wife’s sister in Ireland bad \\njust died after many years of fighting cancer and that cancer \\nhad cost him a pretty penny. Now the funeral would cost him \\nmore. His own uncles and aunts in the old country needed a \\nlittle help now and then to keep their potato farms and he sent \\nthe money to do the trick. He didn’t begrudge it. And when he \\nand his wife visited the old country they were treated like a \\nking and queen. Maybe they would go again this summer now \\nthat the war was over and with all this extra money coming in. \\nMcQuskey told his patrolman clerk where he would be if he \\nwas needed. He did not feel it necessary to take any precautions. \\nHe could always claim Sollozzo was an informer he was meeting. \\nOutside the station house he walked a few blocks and then \\ncaught a cab to the house where he would meet with Sollozzo. \\n\\nIt was Tom Hagen who had to make all the arrangements \\n\\n\\n\\nfor Michael’s leaving the country, his fidse passport, his sea- \\nman’s card, his berth on an Italian freighter that would dock \\nin a Sicilian port. Emissaries were sent that very day by plane \\nto Sicily to prepare a hiding place with the Ma& chief in the \\nhill country. \\n\\nSonny arranged for a car and an absolutely trustworthy \\ndriver to be waiting for Michael when he stepped out of the \\nrestaurant where the meeting would be held with Sollozzo. \\nThe driver would be Tessio himself, who had volunteered for \\nthe job. It would be a beat-up-looking, cat but with a fine \\nmotor. It would have phony licence plates and the car itself \\nwould be untraceable. It had been saved for a special job \\nrequiring the best. \\n\\nMichael spent the day with Qemenza, practising with the \\nsmall gun ti^ would be got to him. It was a .22 filled with \\nsoft-nosed bullets that made pinpricks going in and left in- \\nsulting gaping holes when they exited from the human body. \\nHe found that it was accurate up to five of his steps away from \\na target. After that the bullets might go anywhere. The trigger \\nwas tight but Qememi^ worked on this with some tools so \\nthat it pulled easier. They decided to leave it noisy. They \\ndidn’t want an innocent bystander misunderstanding the situ- \\nation and interfering out of ignorant courage. The report of \\nthe gun would keep them away from Michael. \\n\\nClemenza kept instructing him during the training session. \\n‘Drop the gun as soon as you’ve finished using it. Just let your \\nhand drop to your side and the gun slip out. Nobody will \\nnotice. Everybody will think you’re still armed. They’ll be \\nstaring at your free. Walk out of the place very quickly but \\ndon’): run. Don’t look anybody directly in the eye but don’t \\nlook away from them either. Remember, they’ll be scared of \\nyou, believe me, they’ll be scared of you. Nobody will inter- \\nfere. As soon as you’re outside Tessio will be in the car waiting \\nfor you. Get in and leave the rest to him. Don’t be worried \\nabout accidents. You’d be surprised how well these afEairs go. \\nNow put this hat on and let’s see how you look.’ He clapped a \\ngrey fedora on Michael’s head. Michael, who never wore a hat; \\ngrimaced; Qemenaa reassured him. *It helps against identifi- \\ncation, just in case. Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to \\n\\n\\n144 \\n\\n\\n\\nchange thek identificatioii when we make them see the light. \\nRemember, Mike, don’t worry about prints. The butt and \\ntrigger are fixed with special tape. Don’t touch any other part \\nof the gun, remember that.’ \\n\\nMichael said, ‘Has Sonny found out where SoUozzo is \\ntaking me?’ \\n\\nGemenza shrugged. ‘Not yet. Sollozzo is being very careful. \\nBut don’t worry about him harming you. The negotiator stays \\nin our hands until you come back safe. If anything happens to \\nyou, the negotiator pays.’ \\n\\n‘Why the hell should he stick his neck out?’ Michael asked. \\n\\n‘He gets a big fee,’ Gemenza said. ‘A small fortune. Also he \\nis an important man in the Families. He knows Sollozzo can’t \\nlet anything happen to him. Your life Is not worth the nego- \\ntiator’s life to Sollozzo. Very simple. You’ll be safe all right. \\nWe’re the ones who catch hell afterwards.’ \\n\\n‘How bad will it be?’ Michael asked. \\n\\n‘Very bad,’ Gemenza said. ‘It means an all-out war with the \\nTattagUa Family against the Corleone Family. Most of the \\nothers will line up with the Tattaglias. The Sanitation De^MUt- \\nment will be sweeping up a lot of dead bodies this winter.’ He \\nihrugged. ‘These things have to happen once every ten years \\nor so. It gets rid of the bad blood. And then if we let them push \\nos around on the little things they wanta take over everyt^g. \\nYou gotta stop them at the beginning. Like th^ shoulda \\nstopped Hitler at Munich, they should never let him get away \\nwidi that, they were just asking for big trouble when they 1^ \\nhim get away with that.’ \\n\\nMichael had heard his finther say this same thing before, only \\nin 1939 before the war actually started. If the J^amilies had \\nbeen running the State Department there would never have \\nbeen World War II, he thought with a grin. \\n\\nThey drove back to the m^ and to the Don’s house, where \\nSonny still made his headquarters. Michael wondered how \\nlong Sonny could stay cooped up in the safe territory of the \\nmall. Eventually, he would have to venture out. They found \\nSonny taking a nap on the couch. On the cofiee table were the \\nremains of his late lunch, scraps of steak and breadcrumbs and \\na half-empty bottle of whisky. \\n\\n\\n*45 \\n\\n\\n\\nHis father’s usuaUy neat office was taking on the look of a \\nbadly kept furnished room. Michael shook his brother awake \\nand saidy * Why don’t you stop living like a bum and get this \\nplace cleaned up.’ \\n\\nSonny yawned. *What the hell are you, inspecting the \\nbarracks? Mike, we haven’t got the word yet where they plan \\nto take you, those bastards SoUozao and McQuskey. If we \\ndon’t find that out, how the hell are we going to get the gun to \\nyou?’ \\n\\n*Can’t I carry it on me?’ Michael asked. ‘Maybe they won’t \\nfrisk me and even if they do maybe they’ll miss it if we’re \\nsmart enough. And even if they find it - so what. They’ll just \\ntake it off me and no harm done.* \\n\\nSonny shook his head. ‘Nah,’ he said. ‘We have to make this \\na sure hit on that bastard SoUoszo. Remember, get him Rrst if \\nyou possibly can. McQuskey is slower and dumber. You \\nshould have plenty of time to take him. Did Qemenza tell you \\nto be sure to drop the gun?’ \\n\\n‘A million times,’ Michael said. \\n\\nSonny got up from the sofa and stretched. ‘How does your \\njaw feel, kid?’ \\n\\n‘Lousy,’ Michael said. The left side of his face ached except \\nthose parts that felt numb because of the drugged wire holding \\nit together. He took the bottle of whisky from the tabic and \\nswigged directly from it. The pain eased. \\n\\nSonny said, ‘ Easy, Mike, now is no time to get slowed up by \\nbooze.’ \\n\\nMichael said, *Oh, Qirist, Sonny, stop playing the big \\nbrother. I’ve been in combat against tougher guys than Sob \\nlozzo and under worse conditions. Where the hell ate his \\nmortars? Has he got air cover? Heavy artillery? Land mines? \\nHe’s just a wise son of a bitch with a big-wheel cop sidekick. \\nOnce anybody makes up their mind to kill them there’s no \\nother problem. That’s the hard part, making up your mind. \\nThcy’U never know what hit them.’ \\n\\nTom Hagen came into the room. He greeted them with a \\nnod and went directly to the falsely-listed telephone. He called \\na few times and then shook his head at Sonny. ‘Not a whisper,’ \\nhe said. ‘Sollozzo is keeping it to himself as long as he can.’ \\n\\n146 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe phone rang. Sonny antweted it and he held up a hand \\nas if to signal for quiet though no one had spoken. He jotted \\nsome notes down on a pad» tl^ said, ‘OK, he’ll be there,’ and \\nhung up the phone. \\n\\nSonny was laughing. ‘That son of a bitch Sollozzo, he really \\nis something. Here’s the deal. At eight tonight he and Captain \\nMcQuskey pick up Mike in front of Jack Dempsey’s bar on \\nBroadway. They go some place to talk, and get this. Mike and \\nSoUozzo talk in Italian so that the Irish cop don’t know what \\nthe hell they are talking about. He even tells me, don’t worry, \\nhe knows McQuskey doesn’t know one word in Italian unless \\nit’s ** soldi** and he’s checked you out, Mike, and knows you \\ncan understand Sicilian dialect.’ \\n\\nMichael said dryly, ‘I’m pretty rusty but we won’t talk \\nlong.* \\n\\nTom Hagen said, ‘We don’t let Mike go until we have the \\nnegotiator. Is that arranged?* \\n\\nQemenza nodded. ‘ The negotiator is at my house playing \\npinochle with three of my men. They wait for a call from me \\nbefore they let him go.’ \\n\\nSonny sank back in the leather armchair. ‘Now how the hell \\ndo we ^d out the meeting place? Tom, we’ve got informers \\nwith the Tattaglia Family, how come they haven’t given us the \\nword?’ \\n\\nHagen shrugged. ‘Sollozzo is really damn smart. He’s play- \\ning this close to the vest, so close that he’s not using any men \\nas a cover. He figures the captain will be enough and that \\nsecurity is more important than guns. He’s right too. We’ll \\nhave to put a tail on Mike and hope for the best.’ \\n\\nSonny shook his head. ‘Nah, anybody can lose a tail when \\nthey really want to. \\'iTiat’s the first thing they’ll check out.’ \\n\\nBy this time it was five in the afternoon. Sonny, with a \\nworried look on his face, said, ‘Maybe we should just let Mike \\nblast whoever is in the car when it tries to pick him up.’ \\n\\nHagen shook his head. ‘What if SoUozzo is not m the car? \\nWe’ve tipped our hand for nothing. Damn it, we have to find \\nout where SoUozzo is taking him.’ \\n\\nQcmenza put in, ‘Maybe we should start trying to figure \\nwhy he’s making it such a big secret’ \\n\\n\\n*47 \\n\\n\\n\\nMichad said impatiently, \\'Because it*s the percentage. Why \\nshould he let us know anything if he can prevent it? Besides, \\nhe smells danger. He must be leery as hell even with that police \\ncaptain for his shadow.’ \\n\\nHagen snapped his fingers. \\'That detective, that guy \\nPhillips. Why don’t you give him a ring. Sonny? Maybe he \\ncan find out where the hell the captain can be reached. It’s \\nworth a try. McCluskey won’t give a damn who knows where \\nhe’s going.’ \\n\\nSonny picked up the phone and dialled a number. He spoke \\nsoftly into the phone, then himg up. ‘He’ll call us back,’ \\nSonny said. \\n\\nThey waited for nearly another thirty minutes and then the \\nphone rang. It was Phillips. Sonny jotted something down on \\nhis pad and then hung up. His face was taut. ‘I think we’ve got \\nit,’ he said. \\'Giptain McCluskey always has to leave word on \\nwhere he can be reached. From eight to ten tonight he’ll be at \\nthe Luna Azure up in the Bronx. Anybody know it?’ \\n\\nTessio spoke confidently. \\'I do. It’s perfect for us. A small \\nfamily place with big booths where people can talk in private. \\nGood food. Everybody minds their own business. Perfect.’ \\nHe leaned over Sonny’s desk and arranged stubbed*out \\ncigarettes into map figures. ‘This is the entrance. Mike, when \\nyou finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner. I’ll \\nspot you and put on my headlights and catch you on the fly. If \\nyou ^ve any trouble, yell and I’ll try to come in and get you \\nout. Gemenza, you gotta work fast. Send somebody up there \\nto plant the gun. They got an old-fashioned toilet with a space \\nbetween the water container and the wall. Have your man \\ntape the gun behind there. Mike, after they frisk you in the car \\nand find you’re clean, they won’t be too worried about you. In \\nthe restaurant, wait a bit before you excuse yourself. No, \\nbetter still, ask permission to go. Act a little in trouble first, \\nvery natural. They can’t figure anything. But when you come \\nout again, don’t waste any time. Don’t sit down again at the \\ntable, start blasting. And don’t take chances. In the head, two \\nshots apiece, and out as fast aft your legs can travel.’ \\n\\nSonny had been listening judiciously. ‘I want somebody \\nvery good, very safe, to plant that gun,’ he told Gemenza. ‘I \\n\\nX48 \\n\\n\\n\\ndon’t wuit my bfothor coming out of tibat toikt wUi }u8t fab \\ndick in hb hand.’ \\n\\nQemenza said emphaticaUy, ^The gun will be tibete.’ \\n\\n^OK,’ Sonny said. ‘Everybody get rolling.’ \\n\\nTessio and Clemenm left. Tom Hagen said, ‘ Sonny, should \\n1 drive Mike down to New York?’ \\n\\n‘No,’ Sonny said. ‘I want you here. When Mike finishes, \\nthen our work begins and I’ll need you. Have you got those \\nnewspaper guys lined up?’ \\n\\nHagen nodded. ‘ I’ll be feeding them info as soon as things \\nbreak.’ \\n\\nSonny got up and came to stand in front of Michael. He \\nshook his hand. ‘OK, kid,’ he said, ‘you’re on. I’ll square it \\nwith Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I’ll get a \\nmessage to your girlfriend when 1 think the time u right \\nOK?’ \\n\\n‘OK,* Mike said. ‘How long do you think before 1 can \\ncomeback?’ \\n\\n‘At least a year,’ Sonny said. \\n\\nTom Hagen put in, \\'The Don might be able to work &8ter \\nthan that, Mike, but don’t count on it. The time element \\nhinges on a lot of factors. How well we can plant stories with \\nefae newsmen. How much the Police Department wants to \\ncover up. How violently the other Families react. There’s \\ngoing to be a hell of a lot of heat and trouble. That’s the only \\nthing we can be sure of.’ \\n\\nMichael shook Hagen’s hand. ‘Do your best,’ he said. ‘I \\ndon’t want to do another three>year stretch away from home.* \\n\\nHagen said gently, ‘It’s not too late to back out, Mike, we \\ncan get somebody dse, we can go back over our ^ternatives. \\nMaybe it’s not necessary to get rid of Sollozzo.’ \\n\\nli^chael laughed. ‘We can talk ourselves into any view- \\npoint,’ he said. ‘But we figured it right the first time. I’ve been \\nriding the gravy train all my life, it’s about time I paid my \\ndues.’ \\n\\n‘You shouldn’t let that broken jaw influence you,’ Hagen \\nsaid. ‘McQuskey is a stupid man and it was business, not \\npersonal.’ \\n\\nFor the second time he saw Michael Q>rleQne’s face freeze \\n\\nM9 \\n\\n\\n\\ninto a mask that tcsembled uncannily the Don’s. *Tom» don’t \\nlet anybody kid you. It’s all personal, every bit of business. \\nEvery piece of shit every man has to eat every day of his life is \\npersonal. They call it business. OK. But it’s personal as hell. \\nYou know where 1 learned that from? The Don. My old man. \\nThe GodBither. If a bolt of lightning hit a friend of his the old \\nman would take it personal. He took my going into the \\nMarines personal. That’s what makes him great. The Great \\nDon. He takes everything personal. Like God. He knows \\nevery feather that fsdls from the tail of a sparrow or however \\nthe hell it goes. Right? And you know something? Accidents \\ndon’t happen to people who take accidents as a personal insult. \\nSo I came late, OK, but I’m coming all the way. Damn right, I \\ntake that broken jaw personal; damn right, I take S0U0220 \\ntrying to kill my father personal.’ He laughed. \\'Tell the old \\nman I lesuned it all from him and that I’m glad I had this \\nchance to pay him back for all he did for me. He was a good \\nfather.’ He paused and then he said thoughtfully to Hagen, \\n\\'You know, I can never remember him hitting me. Or Sonny. \\nOr Freddie. And of course Connie, he wouldn’t even yell at \\nher. And tell me the truth, Tom, how many men do you figure \\nthe Don killed or had killed.’ \\n\\nTom Hagen turned away. \\'I’ll tell you one thing you didn’t \\nlearn from him: talking the way you’re talking now. There are \\nthings that have to be done and you do them and you never \\ntalk about them. You don’t try to justify them. They can’t be \\njustified. You just do them. Then you forget it.’ \\n\\nMichael Corleone frowned. He said quietly, \\'As the \\nConsigliori^ you agree that it’s dangerous to the Don and our \\nFamily to let SoUozzo live?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ Hagen said. \\n\\n\\'OK,’ Michael said. \\'Then I have to kill him. \\n\\nMichael Corleone stood in front of Jack Dempsey’s restau- \\nrant on Broadway and waited for his pickup. He looked at his \\nwatch. It said five minutes to eight. Sollozzo was going to be \\npunctual. Michael had made sure he was there in plenty of \\ntime. He had been waiting fifteen minutes. \\n\\nAll during dbe ride from Long Beach into the city he had \\n\\n\\n150 \\n\\n\\n\\nbeen tqrifig to forget what he had said to Hagen. For if he \\nhelieved what he said, then his life was set on an irrerocahlc \\ncourse. And yet, could it be otherwise after tonight? He \\nmight be dead after tonight if he didn\\'t stop all this crap, \\nMichael thought grimly. He had to keep his mind on the \\nbusiness at hand. Soilozzo was no dummy and McQuskcy was \\na very tough egg. He felt the ache in his vnred jaw and wel- \\ncomed the pain, it would keep him alert. \\n\\nBroadway vrasn’t that crowded on this cold winter night, \\neven though it was near theatre time. Michael flinched as a \\nlong black car pulled up to the kerb and the driver, leaning \\nover, opened front door and said, ‘Get in, Mike.* He \\ndidn\\'t know the driver, a young punk with slick black hair \\nand an open shut, but he got in. In the back seat were Captain \\nMcQuskey and Soilozzo. \\n\\nSoilozzo reached a hand over the back of the seat and \\nMichael shook if. The hand was Arm, warm and dry. Soilozzo \\nsaid, ‘I*m glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten \\neverything out. All this is terrible, it\\'s not the way I wanted \\nthings to happen at ail. It should never have happened.* \\nMichael C.orleone said quietly, ‘I hope we can settle things \\ntonight, 1 don’t want my father bothered any more.* \\n\\n‘He won’t be,* Soilozzo said sincerely. ‘1 swear to you by \\nmy children he won’t be. Just keep an open mind when we \\n.talk. 1 hope you’re not a hothead like your brother Sonny. It’s \\nimpCssible to talk business with him.’ \\n\\nOptain Meduskey grunted. ‘He’s a good kid, he’s all \\nright.’ He leaned over to give Michael an affectionate pat on \\nthe shoulder. ‘I’m sorry about the other night, Mike. I’m \\ngetting too old for my job, too grouchy. 1 guess I’ll have to \\nretire pretty soon. Can’t stand the aggravation, all day 1 get \\naggravation. You know how it is.’ Then with a dolefiil sigh, \\nhe gave Michael a thorough frisk for a weapon. \\n\\nI^diad saw a slight sn^e on the driver’s lips. The car was \\ngoing west with no apparent attempt to elude any trailers. It \\nwent up on to the West Side Highway, speeding in and out of \\ntraffic. Anyone following would have had to do the same. \\nThen to Mchael’s dismay it took the exit for the George \\nWashington Bridge, they were going over to New Jersey. \\n\\n\\n*51 \\n\\n\\n\\nWhoever had given Sonny the info on where the meeting was \\nto be held had given him the wrong dope. \\n\\nThe car threaded through the bridge approaches and then \\nwas on it, leaving the blaaing city behind. Michael kept his hice \\nimpassive. Were they going to dump him into the swamps or \\nwas It just a last-minute change in meeting place by the wily \\nS0II0Z20? But when they were nearly all the way across, the \\ndriver gave the wheel a violent twist. The heavy automobile \\njumped into the air when it hit the divider and bounced over \\ninto the lanes going back to New York City. Both McCluskey \\nand S0II0220 were looking back to see if anyone had tried \\ndoing the same thing. The driver was really hitting it back to \\nNew York and then they were off the bridge and going to- \\nwards the East Bronx. They went through side streets with no \\ncars behind them. By this time it was nearly nine o\\'clock. They \\nhad made sure there was no one on their tail. S0II0220 lit up a \\ncigarette after offering his pack to McQuskey and Michael, \\nboth of whom refused. S0II0220 said to the driver, ‘Nice \\nwork. I’ll remember it.’ \\n\\nTen minutes later the car pulled up in front of a restaurant \\nin a small Italian neighbourhood. There was no one on the \\nstreets and because of the lateness of the hour only a few people \\nwere still at dinner. Michael had been worried that the driver \\nwould come in with them, but he stayed outside with his car. \\nThe negotiator had not mentioned a driver, nobody had. \\nTechnically Sollozzo had broken the agreement by bringing \\nhim along. But Michael decided not to mention it, knowing \\nthey would think he would be afraid to mention it, afraid of \\nruining the chances for the success of the parley. \\n\\nThe three of them sat at the only round table, Sollozzo re- \\nfusing a booth. There were only two other people in the \\nrestaurant. Michael wondered whether they were Sollozzo \\nplants. But it didn’t matter^ Before they could interfere it \\nwould be all over. \\n\\nMcCluskey asked with real interest, ‘Is the Italian food \\ngood here?’ \\n\\nSollozzo reassured him. ‘Try the veal, it’s the finest in New \\nYork.’ The solitary waiter had brought a bottle of wine to the \\ntable and uncork^ it. He poured three ghiMfi fiilL Sur- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npriflingly McQuskey did not drink* *I must be the only Irish- \\nman who don’t take the boo 2 e/ he said. ‘1 seen too many good \\npeople get in trouble because of the booze.’ \\n\\nSollozzo said placatingly to the captain, *1 am going to talk \\nItalian to Mike, not because I don’t trust you but because 1 \\ncan’t explain myself properly in English and I want to con- \\nvince Mike that 1 mean well, that it’s to everybody’s advantage \\nfor us to come to an agreement tonight. Don’t be insulted by \\nthis, it’s not that I don’t trust you.’ \\n\\nGiptain McCluskey gave them both an ironic grin. ‘Sure, \\nyou two go right ahead,’ he said. ‘I’U concentrate on my veal \\nand spaghetti.’ \\n\\nSolloz 20 began speaking to Michael in rapid Sicilian. He \\nsaid, ‘You must understand that what happened between me \\nand your father was strictly a business matter. I have a great \\nrespect for Don Corleone and would beg for the opportunity \\nto enter his service. But you must understand that your father \\nis an old-fashioned man. He stands in the way of progress. The \\nbusiness I am in is the coming thing, the wave of the future, \\nthere are untold millions of dollars for everyone to make. But \\nyour father stands in the way because of certain unrealistic \\nscruples. By doing this he imposes his will on men like myself. \\nYes, yes, I know, he says to me, “Go ahead, it’s your \\nbusiness,” but we both know that is unrealistic. We must tread \\non each other’s corns. What he is really telling me is that 1 \\ncannot operate my business. 1 am a man who respects himself \\nand cannot let another man impose his will on me so what had \\nto happen did happen. Let me say that I had the support, the \\nsilent support of all the New York Families. And the Tattaglia \\nFamily became my partners. Ifthis quarrel continues, then the \\nCorleone Family will stand alone against everyone. Perhaps if \\nyour hither were well, it could be done. But the eldest son is \\nnot the man the Godfather is, no disrespect intended. And the \\nIrish Consigliwriy Hagen, is not the man Genco Abbandando \\nwas, God rest his soul. So I propose a peace, a truce. Let us \\ncease all hostilities until your father is weU again and can take \\npart in these bargainings. The Tattaglia Family agrees, upon \\nmy persuasions and my indemnities, to forgo justice for their \\nson Bruno. We will have peace. Meanwhile, 1 have to make a \\n\\n\\n*53 \\n\\n\\n\\nliving and will do a little trading in my business. 1 do not ask \\nyour cooperation but 1 ask you, the Corleone Family, not to \\ninterfere. These are my proposals. I assume you have the \\nauthority to agree, to make a deal.’ \\n\\nMichael said in Sicilian, *Tell me more about how you \\npropose to start your business, exactly what part my Family \\nhas to play in it and what profit we can take from this busi- \\nness.’ \\n\\n‘You want the whole proposition in detail then?* Sollo 2 zo \\nasked. \\n\\nMichael said gravely, ‘Most important of all I must have \\nsure guarantees that no more attempts will be made on my \\nfather’s life.’ \\n\\nS0II0220 raised his hand expressively. ‘ What guarantees can \\n1 give you? I’m the hunted one. I’ve missed my chance. You \\nthink too highly of me, my friend. I am not that clever.’ \\n\\nMichael was sure now that the conference was only to gain a \\nfew days* time. That Soilo2zo would make another attempt to \\nkill the Don. What was beautiful was that the Turk was under- \\nrating him as a punk kid. Michael felt that strange delicious \\nchill filling his body. He made his face look distressed. Sol- \\nlo220 asked sharply, ‘What is itr’ \\n\\nMichael said with an embarrassed air, ‘The wine went right \\nto my bladder. I’ve been holding it in. Is it all right if I go to \\nthe bathroom.’ \\n\\nSollo220 was searching his face intently with his dark eyes. \\nHe reached over and roughly thrust liis hand in Michael’s \\ncrotch, under it and around, searching for a weapon. Michael \\nlooked ofiended. McQuskey said curtly, ‘1 frisked him. I’ve \\nfrisked thousands of young punks. He’s clean.’ \\n\\nSpllozzo didn\\'t like it. For no reason at all he didn’t like ft. \\nHe glanced at the man sitting at a table opposite them \\nand raised his eyebrows towards the door of the bathroom. \\nThe man gave a slight nod that he had checked it, that \\nthere was nobody inside. SoUozzo said reluctantly, ‘Don’t \\ntake too long.’ He had marvellous antennae, he was \\nnervous. \\n\\nMichael got up and went into the bathroom. The urinal had \\na pink bar ^ soap in it secured by a wire net. He went into the \\n\\n\\n154 \\n\\n\\n\\nbooth. He really had to go, his bowels were loose. He did it \\nvery quickly, then reached behind the enamel water cabinet \\nun^ his hand touched the small, blunt-nose gun fastened with \\ntape. He ripped the gun loose, remembering that Qemenasa \\nhad said not to worry about leaving prints on the tape. He \\nshoved the gun into his waistband and buttoned his jacket \\nover it. He washed his hands and wet his hair. He wiped his \\nprints off the faucet with his handkerchief. Then he left the \\ntoilet. \\n\\nSollozzo was sitting directly facing the door of the toilet, his \\ndark eyes blazing with alertness. Michael gave a smile. * Now I \\ncan talk,’ he said with a sigh of relief. \\n\\nCaptain McGuskey was eating the plate of veal and spaghetti \\nthat had arrived. The man on the far wall had been stiff with \\nattention, now he too relaxed visibly. \\n\\nMichael sat down again. He remembered Gemenza had told \\nhim not to do this, to come out of the toilet and blaze away. \\nBut either out of some warning instinct or sheer funk he had \\nnot done so. He had felt that if he had made one swift move he \\nwould have been cut down. Now he felt safe and he must have \\nbeen scared because he was glad he was no longer standing on \\nhis legs. They had gone weak with trembling. \\n\\nSollozzo was leaning towards him. Michael, his belly covered \\nby the table, unbuttoned his jacket and listened intently. He \\ncould not understand a word the man was saying. It was \\nliteraUy gibberish to him. His mind was so fiUed with pound- \\ning blood that no word registered. Underneath the table his \\nright hand moved to the gun tucked into his waistband and he \\ndrew it free. At that moment the waiter came to take their \\norder and Sollozzo turned his head to speak to ^e waiter. \\nMichael thrust the table away from him with his left hand and \\nhis right hand shoved the gun almost against Sollozzo’s head. \\nThe man’s coordination was so acute that he had already begun \\nto fling himself away at Michael’s motion. But I^chael, \\nyounger, his reflexes sharper, pulled the trigger. The bullet \\ncaught Sollozzo squarely between his eye and his ear and \\nwhen it exited on the other side blasted out a huge gout of \\nblood and skull fragments on to the petrified waiter’s jacket. \\nInstinctively Michael knew that one bullet was enough. \\n\\n\\n*55 \\n\\n\\n\\nSoUozzo had turned his head in that last moment and he had \\nseen the light of life die in the man\\'s eyes as clearly as a candle \\ngoes out. \\n\\nOnly one second had gone by as Michael pivoted to bring \\nthe gun to bear on McQuskey. The police captain was staring \\nat Solloz2o with phlegmatic surprise, as if this had nothing to \\ndo with him. He did not seem to be aware of his own danger. His \\nveal-covered fork was suspended in his hand and his eyes were \\njust turning on Michael. And the expression on his face, in his \\neyes, held such confident outrage, as if now he expected \\nhfichael to surrender or to run away, that Michael smiled at \\nhim as he pulled the trigger. This shot was bad, not mortal. It \\ncaught McQuskey in his thick bull-like throat and he started \\nto choke loudly as if he had swallowed too large a bite of the \\nveal. Then the air seemed to fill with a fine mist of spra 3 red \\nblood as he coughed it out of his shattered lungs. Very coolly, \\nvery deliberately, Michael fired the next shot through the top \\nof his white-haired skuU. \\n\\nThe air seemed to be full of pink mist. Michael swung to- \\nwards the man sitting against the wall. This nuin had not made \\na move. He seemed paralysed. Now he carefully showed his \\nhands on top of the table and looked away. The waiter was \\nstaggering back towards the kitchen, an expression of horror \\non his face, staring at Michael in disbelief. SoUozzo was sdll in \\nhis chair, the side of his body propped up by the table. Mo- \\nQuskey, his heavy body pulling downward, had fallen off his \\nchair on to the floor. Michael let the gun slip out of his hand so \\nthat it bounced off his body and made no noise. He saw that \\nneither the man against the wall nor the waiter had noticed \\nhim dropping the gun. He strode the few steps towards the \\ndoof and opened it. Sollozzo’s car was parked at the kerb still, \\nbut there was no sign of the driver. Michael turned left and \\naround the comer. Headlights flashed on and a battered \\nsedan pulled up to him, the door swinging open. He jumped \\nin and the car roared away. He saw that it was Tessio at the \\nwheel, his trim features hard as marble. \\n\\n*Did you do the job on SoUozzo?’ Tessio asked. \\n\\nFor that moment Michael was struck by the idiom Tessio \\nhad used. It was always used in a sexual sense, to do the job on \\n\\n156 \\n\\n\\n\\na woman meant seducing her. It was curious that Tessio used \\nit now. ‘ Both of them/ Michael said. \\n\\n‘ Sure ? ’ Tessio asked. \\n\\n\"T saw their brains/ Michael said. \\n\\nThere was a change of clothes for Michael in the car. \\nTwenty minutes later he was on an Italian freighter slated for \\nSicily. Two hours later the freighter put out to sea and from \\nhis cabin Michael could see the lights of New York Qty \\nburi^g like the fires of hell. He felt an enormous sense of \\nrelief. He was out of it now. The feeling was familiar and he \\nremembered being taken off the beach of an island his Marine \\ndivision had invaded. The battle had been still going on but he \\nhad received a slight wound and was being ferried back to a \\nhospital ship. He had felt the same overpowering relief then \\nthat he felt now. All hell would break loose but he wouldn’t be \\nthere. \\n\\nOn the day after the murder of Sollozao and Captain Me- \\nQuskey, the police captains and lieutenants in every station \\nhouse in New York City sent out the word ; there would be no \\nmore gambling, no more prostitution, no more deals of any \\nkind until the murderer of Captain McCluskey was caught. \\nMassive raids began all over the city. All unlawful business \\nactivities came to a standstill. \\n\\nLater that day an emissary from the Families asked the Cor- \\nleone Family if they were prepared to give up the murderer. \\nThey were told that the affair did not concern them. That \\nnight a bomb exploded in the Corleone Family mall in Long \\nBeach, thrown firom a car that pulled up to the chain, then \\nroared away. That night also two button men of the Corleone \\nFamily were killed as they peaceably ate their dinhfer in a small \\nItalian restaurant in Greenwich Village. The Five Families War \\nof 1946 had begun. \\n\\n\\n157 \\n\\n\\n\\nBook II \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWELVE \\n\\n\\nJo HN NT Fontane wavcd a casual dismissal to the manservant \\nand said, ‘ Sec you in the morning, Billy. ’ ITie coloured butler \\nbowed his way out of the huge dining room-living room with \\nits view of the Pacific Ocean. It was a friendly-goodbye sort of \\nbow, not a servant\\'s bow, and given only because Johnny \\nFontane had company for dinner. \\n\\nJohnny\\'s company was a girl named Sharon Moore, a New \\nYork Qty Greenwich Village girl in Hollywood to try for a \\nsmall part in a movie being produced by an old flame who had \\nmade the big time. She had visited the set while Johnny was \\nacting in the Wolt2 movie. Johnny had found her young and \\nfiresh and charming and witty, and had asked her to come to his \\nplace for dinner that evening. His invitations to dinner were \\nalready famous and had the force of royalty and of course she \\nsaid yes. \\n\\nSharon Moore obviously expected him to come on very \\nstrong because of his reputation, but Johmiy hated the Holly- \\nwood ‘piece of meat’ approach. He never slept with any girl \\nunless foere was something about her he really liked. Except, \\nof course, sometimes when he was very drunk and found him- \\nself in bed with a girl he didn’t even remember meeting or \\nseeing before. And now that he was thirty-five years old, \\ndivor/ced once, estranged from his second wife, with maybe \\na thousand pubic scalps dangling from his bdt, be simply \\nwasn’t that eager. But there was something about Sharon \\nMoore that aroused affection in him and so he had invited her \\nto dinner. \\n\\nHe never ate much but he knew young pretty girls am- \\nbitiously starved themselves for pretty clothes and were \\nusually big eaters on a date so there was plenty of food on the \\ntable. There was also plenty of liquor: champagne in a bucket, \\n\\n158 \\n\\n\\n\\nScotch, rye, brandy, 4Uid liqueurs on the sideboard. Johnny \\nserved the drinks and the plates of food already prepared. \\nWhen they had finished earing he led her into the huge living \\nroom with its glass wall that looked oik on to the Pacific. He \\nput a stack of Ella Fitzgerald records on the hi-fi and settled on \\nthe conch with Sharon. He made a little small talk with her, \\nfound out about what she had been like as a kid, whether she \\nhad been a tomboy or boy crazy, whether she had been homely \\nor pretty, lonely or gay. He always ^ound these details touch- \\ning, it always evoked the tenderness he needed to make love. \\n\\nThey nestled together on the sofa, very friendly, very com- \\nfortable. He kissed her on the lips, a cool frien^y kiss, and \\nwhen she kept it that way he left it that way. Outside the huge \\npicture window he could sec the dark blue sheet of the Pacific \\nlying flat beneath the moonlight. \\n\\n‘How come you’re not playing any of your records?’ \\nSharon asked him. Her voice was teasing. Johnny smiled at \\nher. He was amused by her teasing him. * I’m not that Holly- \\nwood,’ he said. \\n\\n‘Play some for me,’ she said. ‘Or sing for me. You know, \\nlike the movies. I’ll bubble up and melt all over you just like \\nthose girls do on the screen.’ \\n\\nJohnny laughed outright. When he had been younger, he \\nhad done just such things and the result had always been \\nstagy, the girls trying- to look sexy and melting, making their \\neyes swim with desire for an imagined fantasy camera. He \\nwould never dream of singing to a girl now; for one thing, he \\nhadn’t sung for months, he didn’t trust his voice. For another \\nthing, amateurs didn’t realize how much professionals de- \\npended on technical help to sound as good as they did. He \\ncould have played his records but he felt the same shyness \\nabout hearing his youthful passionate voice as an ageing, balding \\nman running to fat feels about showing pictures of himself as a \\nyouth in the full bloom of manhood. \\n\\n‘My voice is out of shape,’ he said. ‘And honesdy. I’m sick \\nof hearing myself sing.’ \\n\\nThey both sipped their drinks. ‘I hear you’re great in this \\npicture,’ she said. ‘Is it true you did it for nothing?’ \\n\\n‘Just a token payment,’ Johnny said. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe got up to give her a refill on her brandy glass, gave her a \\ngold-monogtammed cigarette and flashed his lighter out to \\nhold the light for her. She pufied on the cigarette and sipped \\nher drink and he sat down l^ide her again. His glass had con- \\nsiderably more brandy in it than hers, he needed it to warm \\nhimself, to cheer himself, to charge himself up. His situation \\nwas the reverse of the lover’s usual one. He had to get himself \\ndrunk instead of the girl. The girl was usually too willing \\nwhere he was not. The last two years had been hell on his ego, \\nand he used this simple way to restore it, sleeping with a young \\nfresh girl for one night, taking her to dinner a few times, \\ngiving her an expensive present, and then brushing her off in \\nthe nicest way possible so that her feelings wouldn’t be hurt. \\nAnd then they could always say they had had a thing with the \\ngreat Johnny Fontaric. It wasn’t true love, but you couldn’t \\nknock it if the girl was beautiful and genuinely nice. He hated \\nthe hard, bitchy ones, the ones who screwed for him and then \\nrushed off to tell their friends that they’d screwed the great \\nJohnny Fontane, always adding that they’d had better. What \\namaaed him more than anything else in his career were the \\ncomplaisant husbands who almost told him to- his face that \\nthey forgave their wives since it was allowed for even the \\nmost virtuous matron to be unfuthful with a great singing and \\nmovie star like Johnny Fontane. That really floored him . \\n\\nHe loved Ella Fitzgerald on records. He loved that kind of \\ndean singing, that kind of dean phrasing. It was the only \\nthing in life he really understood and he knew he understood \\nit better than anyone dse on earth. Now lying back on the \\ncouch, the brandy warming his throat, he fdt a desire to sing, \\nnot music, but to phrase with the records, yet it was something \\nimpbssible to do in front of a stranger. He put his free hand in \\nShiuron’s lap, sipping his drink from his o^er hand. Without \\nany slyness but with the sensualness of a child seeking warmth, \\nhis hand in her lap pulled up the silk of her dress to show \\nmilky white thigh above the sheer netted gold of her stockings \\nand as always, despite all the women, ^ the years, all the \\nfiuniliarhy, Johnny felt the fluid sticky wacmoess flooding \\nthrough his body at that sight. The mirade still happened, and \\nwhat would he do when t^t fidlcd him as his voioe hadP \\n\\n160 \\n\\n\\n\\nHe was ready now. He pot his drink down on die long in- \\nlaid cocktail table and turned his body towards ber. He was \\nvery sure, very deliberate, and yet tender. There was nothing \\nsly or lecherously lascivious in his caresses. He kissed her on \\nthe lips while his hands rose to her breasts. His hand fell to her \\nwarm thighs, the skin so silky to his touch. Her returning kiss \\nwas warm but not passionate and he preferred it that way \\nright now. He hated girls who turned on all of a sudden as if \\ntheir bodies were motors galvanized into erode pumpings by \\nthe touching of a hairy switch. \\n\\nThen he did something he always did, something that had \\nnever yet failed to arouse him. Delicately and as lightly as it \\nwas possible to do so and still feel something, he brushed the \\ndp of his middle dnger deep down between her thighs. Some \\ngirls never even felt that inidal move towards lovemaking. \\nSome were distracted by it, not sure it was a physical touch \\nbecause at the same dme he always kissed them deeply on the \\nmouth. Srill others seemed to suck in his hnger or gobble it up \\nwith a pelvic thrust. And of course before he became famous, \\nsome girls had slapped his face. It was his whole technique and \\nusually it served him well enough. \\n\\nSharon’s reaction was unusual. She accepted it all, the \\ntouch, the kiss, then shifted her mouth off his, shifted her body \\never so slightly back along the couch and picked up her drink. \\nIt was a cool but definite refusal. It happened somedmes. \\nRarely; but it happened. Johnny picked up his drink and lit a \\ncigarette. \\n\\nShe was saying something very sweedy, very lightly. *It*8 \\nnot that I don’t like you, Johnny, you’re much nicer than I \\nthought you’d be. And it’s not because I’m not that kind of a \\ngirl. It’s just that I have to be turned on to do it with a guy, \\nyou know what I mean?’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontane smiled at her. He still liked her. *And 1 \\ndon’t turn you on?’ \\n\\nShe was a litde embarrassed. \\'Well, you know, when you \\nwere so great singing and all, I was still a Utde kid. I sort of just \\nmissed you, I was the next generadon. Honest, it’s not that \\nI*ffi goody-goody. If you were James Dean or somebody I grew \\nop on, rd have my pandes o£ in a second.’ \\n\\ni6i \\n\\n\\nGodftrhcf- 6 \\n\\n\\n\\nHe didn’t like her quite $o mudt now. She was aweet, the \\nwas witty, she was int^gent. She hadn’t &llen all ovei herself \\nto screw for him or try to hustle him because his connexions \\nwould help her in show hiz. She was really a straight kid. But \\nthere was something else he recognized. It had happened a \\nfew times before. The girl who went on a date with her mind \\nall made up not to go to bed with him, no matter how mudi \\nshe liked him, just so that she could tell her friends, and even \\nmore, herself, that she had turned down a chance to screw for \\nthe great Johnny Fontane. It was something he understood \\nnow that he was older and he wasn’t angry. He just didn’t like \\nher quite that much and he had really liked her a lot. \\n\\nAnd now diat he didn’t like her quite so much, he relaxed \\nmore. He sipped his drink and watched the Pacific Ocean. She \\nsaid, ‘I hope you’re not sore, Johnny. I guess I’m being \\nsquare, I guess in Hollywood a girl’s supposed to put out just \\nas casually as kissing a beau goodnight. I just haven’t been \\naround long enough.’ \\n\\nJohnny smiled at her and patted her cheek. His hand fell \\ndown to puli her skirt discreetly over her rounded silken \\nknees. ‘I’m not sore,’ he said. ‘It’s nice having an old- \\nfashioned date.’ Not telling what he felt: the relief at not \\nhaving to prove himself a great lover, not having to live up to \\nhis screened, godlike image. Not having to listen to the girl \\ntrying to react as if he really had lived up t;o that image, making \\nmore out of a very simple, routine piece of ass than it really \\nwas. \\n\\nThey had another drink, shared a few more cool kisses and \\nthen she decided to go. Johnny said politely, ‘Gm I call you \\nfor dinner some night?’ \\n\\nShe played it frank and honest to the end. ‘I know you \\ndon’t want to waste your time and then get disappointed,’ she \\nsaid. ‘Thanks for a wonderful evening. Some day I’ll tell my \\nchildren I had suppei with the great Johnny Fontane all alone \\nin his apartment.’ \\n\\nHe smiled at her. ‘And that you didn’t give in,’ he said. \\nThey both laughed. ‘They’ll never believe that,’ she said. And \\nthen Johnny, being a little phony in his turn, said, ‘I’ll give it \\nto you in writing, want me to?’ She shook her h^. He con- \\n\\n162 \\n\\n\\n\\ntinued on. ‘Anybody doubts you, give me a buz2 on the phone, \\n1*11 straighten them right out. Fll tell them how I chased you \\nall around the apartment but you kept your honour. OK?’ \\n\\nHe had, finally, been a little too cruel and he felt stricken at \\nthe hurt on her young face. She understood that he was telling \\nher that he hadn’t tried too hard. He had taken the sweetness \\nof her victory away from her. Now she would feel that it had \\nbeen her lack of charm or attractiveness that had made her the \\nvictor this night. And being the girl she was, when she told the \\nstory of how she resisted the great Johnny Fontane, she \\nwould always have to add with a wry litde smile, ‘Of course, \\nhe didn’t try very hard.’ So now taking pity on her, he said, ‘ If \\nyou ever feel real down, give me a ring. c3k? I don’t have to \\nshack up every girl 1 know.* \\n\\n‘1 wiU,’ she said. She went out the doot. \\n\\nHe was left with a long evening before him. He could have \\nused what Jack Woltz called the ‘meat factory’, the stable of \\nwilling starlets, but he wanted human companionship. .He \\nwanted to talk like a human being. He thought of his first wife, \\nVirginia. Now that the work on the picture was finished he \\nwould have more time for the kids. He wanted to become part \\nof their life again. And he worried about Virginia too. She \\nwasn’t equipped to handle the Hollywood sharpies who might \\ncome after her just so that they could brag about having \\nscrewed Johnny Fontane’s first wife. As far as he knew, no- \\nbody could say that yet. Everybody could say it about his \\nsecond wife though, he thought wryly. He picked up the \\nphone. \\n\\nHe recognized her voice immediately and that was not sur- \\nprising. He had heard it the first time when he was ten years \\nold and they had been in 4B together. ‘Hi, Ginny,* he said, \\n‘you busy tonight? Can I come over for a little while?* \\n\\n‘All right,’ she said. ‘The kids are sleeping though; 1 don’t \\nwant to wake them up.* \\n\\n‘That’s OK,’ he said. ‘1 just wanted to talk to you.* \\n\\nHer voice hesitated slightly, then carefully controlled not to \\nshow any concern, she asked, ‘Is it anything serious, anything \\nimportant?* \\n\\n‘No,’ Johnny said. ‘I finished the picture today and I \\n\\n165 \\n\\n\\n\\nthought maybe 1 could just see you and talk to you. Maybe 1 \\ncould take a look at the kids If you*re sure diey won*t wake \\nup.* \\n\\n*OK,* she said. ‘I’m glad you got that part you wanted.’ \\n\\n‘Thanks/ he said. ‘I’ll sec you in about a haLT hour.’ \\n\\nWhen he got to what had been his home in Beverly Hills, \\nJohnny Fontane sat in the car for a moment staring at the \\nhouse. He remembered what his Godfather had said, that he \\ncould make his own life what he wanted. Great chance if you \\nknew what you wanted. But what did he want? \\n\\nHis first wife was waiting for him at the door. She was \\npretty, petite and brunette, a nice Italian girl, the girl next door \\nwho would never fool around with another man and that had \\nbeen important to him. Did he still want her, he asked himself, \\nand the answer was no. For one thing, he could no longer \\nmake love to her, their affection had grown too old. And \\nthere were some things, nothing to do with sex, she could \\nnever forgive him. But they were no longer enemies. \\n\\nShe made him cofiee and served him homemade cookies to \\nthe living room. ‘Stretch out on the sofa,’ she said, ‘you look \\ntired.’ He took oQ his jacket and his shoes and loosened his tie \\nwhile she sat in the chair opposite liim with a grave little smile \\non her fiice. ‘It’s funny,’ she said. \\n\\n‘What’s fonny?’ he asked her, sipping coffee and spilling \\nsome of it on his shirt, \\n\\n‘The great Johnny Fontane stuck without a date,’ she said. \\n\\n‘The great Johnny Fontane is lucky if he can even get it up \\nany more/ he said. \\n\\nIt was unusual for him to be so direct. Ginny asked, ‘ Is there \\nsomething really the. matter?’ \\n\\nJohnny grinned at her. ‘I had a date with a girl in my apart- \\nment and she brushed me off. And you know, I was relieved.’ \\n\\nTo his surprise he saw a look of anger pass over Ginny’s \\nface. ‘Don’t worry about those little tramps,’ she said. ‘She \\nmust have thought that was the way to get you interested in \\nher.’ And Johnny realized with amusement that Ginny was \\nactually angry with the girl who had turned him down. \\n\\n‘Ah, what the hell,’ he said. ‘I’m tired of that stuff. I have to \\ngrow up sometime. And now that 1 can’t sing any more 1 guess \\n\\n164 \\n\\n\\n\\nrU have a tough time with dames. I never got in on my looks, \\nyou know.’ \\n\\nShe said loyally, ‘You were always better looking than you \\nphotographed.’ \\n\\nJohnny shook his head. ‘I’m getting fat and I’m getting \\nbald. Hell, if this picture doesn’t make me big again I better \\nlearn how to bake pizzas. Or maybe we’ll put you in the \\nmovies, you look great.’ \\n\\nShe looked thirty-five. A good thirty-five, but thirty-five. \\nAnd out here in HoDywood that might as well be a hundred. \\nThe young beautiful girls thronged through the city like \\nlemmings, lasting one year, some two. Some of them so beauti- \\nful they could make a man’s heart almost stop beating until \\nthey opened their mouths, until the greedy hopes for success \\nclouded the loveliness of their eyes. Ordinary women could \\nnever hope to compete with them on a physical level. And you \\ncould talk all you wanted to about charm, about intelligence, \\nabout chic, about poise, the raw beauty of these girls over- \\npowered everything else. Perhaps if there were not so many of \\nthem there might be a chance for an ordinary, nice-looking \\nwoman. And since Johnny Fontane could have all of them, or \\nnearly all of them, Ginny knew that he was saying all this just \\nto flatter her. He had always been nice that way. He had always \\nbeen polite to women even at the height of his fame, paying \\nthem compliments, holding lights for their cigarettes, opening \\ndoors. And since all this was usually done for him^ it made it \\neven more impressive to the girls he went out with. And he \\ndid it with all girls, even the one-night stands, I-don’t-know- \\nyour-name girls. \\n\\nShe smiled at him, a friendly smile. ‘You already made me, \\nJohnny, remember? For twelve years. You don’t*havc to give \\nme your* line.’ \\n\\nHe sighed and stretched out on the sofa. ‘No kidding, \\nGinny, you look good. I wish I looked that good.* \\n\\nShe didn’t answer him. She could see he was depressed. ‘Do \\nyou think the picture is OK? Will it do you some good?* she \\nasked. \\n\\nJohnny nodded. ‘Yeah. It could bring me all the way back. \\nIf I get the Academy thing and play my cards right, I can make \\n\\n165 \\n\\n\\n\\nit big again even without the singing. Then maybe I can give \\nyou and the kids more dough.* \\n\\n* We have more than enough/ Ginny said. \\n\\n‘I wanta see more of the kids too/ Johnny said. ‘I want to \\nsettle down a little bit. Why can’t I come every Friday night \\nfor dinner here? I swear Til never miss one Friday, I don’t care \\nhow far away 1 am or how busy 1 am. And then whenever 1 \\ncan rU spend weekends or maybe the kids can spend some \\npart of their vacations with me.’ \\n\\nGinny put an ashtray on his chest. ‘It’s OK with me,’ she \\nsaid. ‘I never got married because I wanted you to keep being \\ntheir father.’ She said this without any kind of emotion, but \\nJohnny Fontane, staring up at the ceiling, knew she said it as \\nan atonement for those other things, the cruel things she had \\nonce said to him when their marriage had broken up, when his \\ncareer had started going down the drain. \\n\\n‘ By the way, guess who called me,* she said. \\n\\nJohnny wouldn’t play that game, he never did. ‘Who?’ he \\nasked. \\n\\nGinny said, ‘You could take at least one lousy guess.’ \\nJohnny didn’t answer. ‘Your Godfather,’ she said. \\n\\nJohnny was really surprised. ‘He never talks to anybody on \\nthe phone. What did he say to you?’ \\n\\n‘He told me to help you,’ Ginny said. ‘He said you could be \\nas big as you ever were, that you were on your way back, but \\nthat you needed people to bdieve in you. 1 asked him why \\nshould I ? And he said because you’re the father of my children. \\nHe’s such a sweet old guy and they tell such horrible stories \\nabout him.’ \\n\\nVirginia hated phones and she had had all the extensions \\ntakep out except for the one in her bedroom and one in the \\nkitchen. Now they could hear the kitchen phone ringing. She \\nwent to answer it. When she came back into the living room \\nthere was a look of surprise on her face. ‘It’s for you, Johnny,’ \\nshe said. ‘It’s Tom Hagen. He says it’s important.’ \\n\\nJohnny went into the kitchen and picked up the phone. \\n‘Yeah, Tom,’ he said. \\n\\nTom Hagen’s voice was cooL ‘Johnny, the God&ther wants \\nme to come out and see you and set some things up that can \\n\\ni66 \\n\\n\\n\\nhelp you out now that the picture is finished. He wants me to \\ncatch the morning plane. Can you meet it in Los Angeles? I \\nhave to fly back to New York the same night so you won’t \\nhave to worry about keeping youi night free for me.’ \\n\\n‘Sure, Tom/ Johnny said. ‘And don’t worry about me \\nlosing a night. Stay over and relax a bit. I’ll throw a party and \\nyou can meet some movie people.’ He always made that offer, \\nhe didn’t want the folks from his old neighbourhood to think \\nhe was ashamed of them. \\n\\n‘Thanks,* Hagen said, ‘but I really have to catch the early \\nmorning plane back. OK, you’ll meet the eleven-thirty am out \\nof New York?’ \\n\\n‘Sure,’ Johnny said. \\n\\n‘ Stay in your car,’ Hagen said. ‘ Send one of your people to \\nmeet me when I get off the plane and bring me to you.’ \\n\\n‘Right,’ Johnny said. \\n\\nHe went back to the living room and Ginny looked at him \\ninquiringly. ‘My Godfather has some plans for me, to help me \\nout,’ Johnny said- ‘He got me the part in the movie, I doh’t \\nknow how. But I wish he’d stay out of the rest of it.’ \\n\\nHe went back on to the sofa. He felt very tired. Ginny said, \\n‘ Why don’t you sleep in the guest bedroom tonight instead of \\ngoing home. You can have breakfast with the kids and you \\nwon’t have to drive home so late. I hate to think of you all \\nalone in that house of yours anyway. Don’t you get lonely?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t stay home much,’ Johnny said. \\n\\nShe laughed and said, ‘Then you haven’t changed much.’ \\nShe paused and then said, ‘Shall 1 fix up the other bedroom?’ \\n\\nJohnny said, ‘Why can’t I sleep in your bedroom?’ \\n\\nShe flushed. ‘No,’ she said. She smiled at him and he smiled \\nback. They were still friends. • \\n\\nWhen Johnny woke up the next morning it was late, he \\ncould tell by the sun coming in through the drawn blinds. It \\nnever came in that way unless it was in the afternoon. He \\nyelled, Tiey, Ginny, do I still rate breakfast?’ And far away he \\nheard her voice call, ‘Just a second.’ \\n\\nAnd it was just a second. She must have had everything \\nready, hot in the oven, the tray waiting to be loaded, b^use \\nas Johnny lit his first cigarette of the day, the door of the \\n\\n167 \\n\\n\\n\\nbedroom opened and his two small daughters came in wheeling \\nthe breakfast cart. \\n\\nThey were so beautiful it broke his heart. Their faces were \\nshining and clear, their eyes alive with curiosity and the eager \\ndesire to run to him. They wore their hair braided old- \\nfashioned in long pigtails and they wore old-fashioned frocks \\nand white patent-leather shoes. They stood by the breakfast \\ncart watching him as he stubbed out his cigarette and waited \\nfor him to call and hold his arms wide. Then they came \\nrunning to him. He pressed his face between their two fresh \\nfragrant cheeks and scraped them with his beard so that they \\nshrieked. Ginny appeared in the bedroom door and wheeled \\nthe breakfast cart the rest of the way so that he could eat in \\nbed. She sat beside him on the edge of the bed, pouring bis \\ncoffee, buttering his toast. The two young daughters sat on \\nthe bedroom couch watching him. They were too old now for \\npillow fights or to be tossed around. They were already \\nsmoothing their mussed hair. Oh, Christ, he thought, pretty \\nsoon they^\\'ll be all grown up, Hollywood punks will be out \\nafter them. \\n\\nHe shared his roast and bacon with them as he ate, gave \\nthem sips of cofi\\'ee. It was a habit left over from when he had \\nbeen singing with the band and rarely ate with them so they \\nliked to share his food when he had his odd-hour meals like \\nafternoon breakfasts ot morning suppers. The change-around \\nin food delighted them - to eat steak and french fries at seven \\nin the morning, bacon and eggs in the afternoon. \\n\\nOnly Ginny and a few of his close friends knew how much \\nhe idolized his daughters. That had been the worst thing about \\nthe divorce and leaving home. The one thing he had fought \\nabout, and for, was his position as a father to them. In a very \\nsly way he had made Ginny understand he would not be \\npleased by her remarrying, not because he was jealous of her, \\nbut because he was jealous of his position as a frther. He had \\natraitged the money to be paid to her so it would be enor- \\nmously to her advantage ^andally not to remarry.. It was \\nunderstood that she could have lovers as long as they were not \\nintroduced into her home life. But on this score 1 ^ had ab- \\nsolute ftddi in her. She had aiwa3r8 been amazingly shy and \\n\\n168 \\n\\n\\n\\nold-fiishiooed in sex. The Hollywood gigolos had batted ztto \\nwhen they started swarming around her, snifHng for the \\nfifiAnrial settlement and the favours they could get from her \\nfamous husband. \\n\\nHe had no fear that she expected a reconciliation because he \\nhad wanted to sleep with her the night before. Neither one of \\nthem wanted to renew their old marriage. She understood his \\nhunger for beauty, his irresistible impulse towards young \\nwomen far more beautiful than she. It was known that he \\nalways slept with his movie co-stars at least once. His boyish \\ncharm was irresistible to them, as their beauty was to him. \\n\\n‘You’ll have to start getting dressed pretty soon,’ Ginny \\nsaid. ‘Tom’s plane will be getting in.’ She shooed the \\ndaughters out of the room. \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Johnny said. ‘By the way, Ginny, you know I’m \\ngetting divorced? I’m gonna be a free man again.’ \\n\\nShe watched him getting dressed. He always kept fresh \\nclothes at her house ever since they had come to their new \\narrangement after the wedding of Don Corleone’s daughter. \\n‘Christmas is only two weeks away,’ she said. ‘Shall I plan on \\nyou being here?’ \\n\\nIt was the first time he had even thought about the holidays. \\nWhen his voice was in shape, holidays were lucrative singing \\ndates but even then Christmas was sacred. If he missed this \\none, it would be the second one. Last year he had been court- \\ning his second wife in Spain, trying to get her to marry him. \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ he said. ‘Christmas Eve and Christmas.’ He didn’t \\nmention New Year’s Eve. That would be one of the wild \\nnights he needed every once in a while, to get drunk with his \\nfriends, and he didn’t want a wife along then. He didn\\'t feel \\nguilty about it. \\n\\nShe helped him put on his jacket and brushed it off. He was \\nalways fastidiously neat. She could see him frowning because \\nthe shirt he had put on was not laundered to his taste, the cuff \\nlinks, a pair he had not worn for some time, were a little too \\nloud for the way he liked to dress now. She laughed softly and \\nsaid, ‘Tom won’t notice the difference.’ \\n\\nllie three women of the funily walked him to the door and \\nout on the driveway to his car. The two little girls held his* \\n\\n169 \\n\\n\\n\\nhands, one on each side. His wife walked a little behind him. \\nShe was getting pleasure out of how happy he looked. When \\nhe reached his car he turned around and swung each girl in \\nturn high up in the air and kissed her on the way down. Then \\nhe kissed his wife and got into the car. He never liked drawn- \\nout goodbyes. \\n\\nArrangements had been made by his PR man and aide. At \\nhis house a chauffeured car was waiting, a rented car. In it \\nwere the PR man and another member of his entourage. \\nJohnny parked his car and hopped in and they were on their \\nway to the airport. He waited inside the car while the PR man \\nwent out to meet Tom Hagen’s plane. When Tom got into the \\ncar they shook hands and drove back to his house. \\n\\nFinally he and Tom were alone in the living room. There \\nwas a coolness between them. Johnny had never forgiven \\nHagen for acting as a barrier to his getting in touch with the \\nDon when the Don was angry with him, in those bad days \\nbefore Connie’s wedding. Hagen never made excuses for his \\nactions. He could not. It was part of his job to act as a light- \\nning rod for resentments which people were too awed to feel \\ntowards the Don himself though he had earned them. \\n\\n‘Your Godfather sent me out here to give you a hand on \\nsome things,’ Hagen said. ‘I wanted to get it out of the way \\nbefore Christmas.’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontanc shrugged. ‘The picture is finished. The \\ndirector was a square guy and treated me right. My scenes are \\ntoo important to be left on the cutdng-room floor just for \\nWoltz to pay me off. He can’t ruin a ten-million-dollar picture. \\nSo now everything depends on how good people think I am in \\nthe mqvie.’ \\n\\nHagen said cautiously, ‘ Is winning this Academy Award so \\nterribly important to an actor’s career, or is it just the usual \\npublicity crap that really doesn’t mean anything one way or \\nthe other?’ He paused and added hastily, ‘Except of course \\nthe glory, everybody likes glory.’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontane grinned at him. ‘Except my Godfather. \\nAnd you. No, Tom, it’s not a lot of crap. An Academy Award \\ncan make an actor for ten years. He can get his pick of roles. \\n\\n\\n170 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe public goes to see him. It^s not everything, but for an \\nactor it*s the most important thing in the business. Fm count- \\ning on winning it. Not because Fm such a great actor but \\nbecause I’m known primarily as a singer and the part is fool- \\nproof. And Fm pretty good too, no kidding.* \\n\\nTom Hagen shrugged and said, ‘Your Godfather tells me \\nthat the way things stand now, you don’t have a chance of \\nwinning the award.* \\n\\nJohnny Fontanc was angry. ‘What the hell are you talking \\nabout? llie picture hasn’t even been cut yet, much less shown. \\nAnd the Don isn’t even in the movie business. Why the hell \\ndid you fly the three thousand miles just to tell me that shit?* \\nHe was so shaken he was almost in tears. \\n\\nHagen said worriedly, ‘Johnny, I don’t know a damn thing \\nabout all this movie stuff. Remember, Fm just a messenger boy \\nfor the Don. But we have discussed this whole business of \\nyours many times. He worries about you, about your future. \\nHe feels you still need his help and he wants to settle your \\nproblem once and for all. That’s why Fm here now, to get \\nthings rolling. But you have to start growing up, Johnny. You \\nhave to stop thinking about yourself as a singer or an actor. \\nYou’ve got to start thinking about yourself as a prime mover, \\nas a guy with muscle,* \\n\\nJohnny Fontane laughed and filled his glass. ‘If 1 don’t win \\nthat Oscar I’ll have as much muscle as one of my daughters. \\nMy voice is gone; if I had that back I could make some moves. \\nOh, hell. How docs my Godfather know I won’t win it? \\nOK. I believe he knows. He’s never been wrong.’ \\n\\nHagen lit a thin cigar. ‘We got the word that Jack Woltz \\nwon’t spend studio money to support your candidacy. In fact \\nhe’s sent the word out to everybody who votes that he does \\nnot want you to win. But holding back the money for ads and \\nall that may do it. He’s also arranging to have one other guy \\nget as much of the opposition votes as he can swing. He’s \\nusing all sorts of bribes - jobs, money, broads, everything. \\nAnd he’s trying to do it without hurting the picture or hurting \\nit as little as possible.’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontane shrugged. He filled his glass with whisky \\nand downed it. ‘Then I’m dead.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nHagen waa watching him widi his mouth cuded up with \\ndistaste. * Drinking won’t help your voice/ he said. \\n\\n‘Fuck you/ Johnny said. \\n\\nHagen’s face suddenly became smoothly impassive. Then he \\nsaid, ‘OK, I’ll keep this purely business.’ \\n\\nJohnny Fontane put his drink down and went over to stand \\nin front of Hagen. ‘I’m sorry I said that, Tom,’ he said. \\n‘Qirist, I’m sorry. I’m taking it out on you because I wanta \\nkill that bastard Jack Woltz and I’m afraid to tell off my God- \\nfrther. So I get sore at you.’ There were tears in his eyes. He \\nthrew the empty whisky glass against the wall but so weakly \\nthat the heavy shot glass did not even shatter and rolled along \\nthe floor back to him so that he looked down at it in baffled \\nfury. Then he laughed. ‘Jesus Christ,’ he said. \\n\\nHe walked over to the other side of the room and sat \\nopposite Hagen. ‘You know, I had everything my own way \\nfor a long time. Then I divorced Ginny and everything started \\ngoing sour. I lost my voice. My records stopped selling. I \\ndidn’t get any more movie work. And then my Godfather got \\nsore at me and wouldn’t talk to me on the phone or see me \\nwhen I came into New York. You were always the guy \\nbarring the path and I blamed you, but I knew you wouldn’t \\ndo it without orders from the Don. But you can’t get sore at \\nhim. It’s like getting sore at God. So I curse you. But you’ve \\nbeen tight all along the line. And to show you I mean my \\napology I’m taking your advice. No more booze until I get \\nmy voice back. OK?’ \\n\\nThe apology was sincere. Hagen forgot his anger. There \\nmust be something to this thirty-five-year-old boy or the \\nDon would not be so fond of him. He said, ‘Forget it, Johnny.’ \\nHe was embarrassed at the depth of Johnny’s feeling and \\nembarrassed by the suspicion that it might have been in- \\nspired by fear, fear that he might turn the Don against him. \\nAnd of course the Don could never be turned by any- \\none for any reason. His affection was mutable o^y by \\nhimself. \\n\\n‘Things aren’t so bad,’ he told Johnny. ‘The Don says he \\ncan cancel out everything Woltz does against you. That you \\nwill almost certainly win the Award. But he f(^8 that won’t \\n\\n\\n\\nsolve your problem. He wants to know if you have the brains \\nand b^s to become a producer on your own, make your own \\nmovies from top to bottom.* \\n\\n‘How the hell is he going to get me the Award?’ Johnny \\nasked incredulously. \\n\\nHagen said sharply, ‘How do you find it so easy to believe \\nthat Woltz can finagle it and your Godfather can’t? Now since \\nit’s necessary to get your faith for the other part of our deal I \\nmust tell you this. Just keep it to yourself. Your Godfather is a \\nmuch more powerful man than Jack Woltz. And he is much \\nmore powerfol in areas far more critical. How can he swing the \\nAward? He controls, or controls the people who control, all \\nthe labour unions in the industry, all the people or nearly all \\nthe people who vote. Of course you have to be good, you \\nhave to be in contention on your own merits. And your God- \\nfather has more brains than Jack Woltz. He doesn’t go up to \\nthese people and put a gun to their heads and say, ‘“Vote for \\nJohnny Fontane or you are out of a job.” He doesn’t strong- \\narm where strong-arm doesn’t work or leaves too many hard \\nfeelings. He’ll make those people vote for you because they \\nwant to. But they won’t want to unless he takes an interest. \\nNow just take my word for it that he can get you the Award. \\nAnd that if he doesn’t do it, you won’t get it.’ \\n\\n*OK,’ Johnny said. ‘I believe you. And I have the balls and \\nbrains to be a producer but 1 don’t have the money. No bank \\nwould finance me. It takes millions to support a movie.’ \\n\\nHagen said dryly, ‘When you get the Award, start making \\nplans to produce three of your own movies. Hire the best \\npeople in the business, the best technicians, the best stars, \\nwhoever you need. Plan on three to five movies^’ \\n\\n‘You’re crazy,’ Johnny said. ‘That many movies could \\nmean twenty million bucks.’ \\n\\n‘When you need the money,’ Hagen said, ‘get in touch with \\nme. I’ll give you the name of the bank out here in California to \\nask for financing. Don’t worry, they finance movies all the \\ntime. Just ask them for the money in the ordinary way, with \\nthe proper justifications, like a regular business deal. They will \\napprove, l^t first you have to see me and tell me the figures \\nand the plans. OK?’ \\n\\n\\n-173 \\n\\n\\n\\nJohnny was silent for a long time. Then he said quietly, *Is \\nthere anything else?’ \\n\\nIJagen smiled. *You mean, do you have to do any &vours \\nin return for a loan of twenty million dollars? Sure you will.’ \\nHe waited for Johnny to say something. ‘Nothing you \\nwouldn’t do anyway if the Don asked you to do it for him.’ \\n\\nJohnny said, ‘The Don has to ask me himself if it’s some- \\nthing serious, you know what I mean? I won’t take your word \\nor Sonny’s for it.’ \\n\\nHagen was surprised by this good sense. Fontane had some \\nbrains after all- He had sense to know that the Don was too \\nfond of him, and too smart, to ask him to do something \\nfoolishly dangerous, whereas Sonny might. He said to \\nJohnny, ‘Let me reassure you on one thing. Your Godfather \\nhas given me and Sonny strict instructions not to involve you \\nin any way in anything that might get you bad publicity \\nthrough our fault. And he will never do that himself. I \\nguarantee you that any favour he asks of you, you will offer \\nto do before he requests it. OK?’ \\n\\nJohnny smiled. ‘OK,’ he said. \\n\\nHagen said, ‘Also he has faith in you. He thinks you have \\nbrains and so he figures the bank will make money on the in- \\nvestment, which means he will make money on it. So it’s \\nreally a business deal, never forget that. Don’t go screwing \\naround with the money. You may be his favourite godson but \\ntwenty million bucks is a lot of dough. He has to stick his neck \\nout to make sure you get it.’ \\n\\n‘Tell him not to worry,’ Johnny said. ‘If a guy like Jack \\nWolt2 can be a big movie genius, anybody can.’ \\n\\n‘ That’s what your Godfather figures,’ Hagen said. ‘ Can you \\nhave me driven back to the airport? I’ve said aU I have to say. \\nWhen you do start signing contracts for everjrthing, hire your \\nown lawyers, I won’t be in on it. But I’d like to see everything \\nbefore you sign,.if that’s OK with you. Also, you’ll never have \\nany labour troubles. That will cut costs on your pictures to \\nsome extent, so when the accountants lump some of that in, \\ndisregard those figures.’ \\n\\nJohnny said cautiously, ‘Do I have to get your OK on any- \\nthing else, scripts, stars, any of that?’ \\n\\n\\n174 \\n\\n\\n\\nHagen shook his head. ‘No/ he said. ‘It may happen that \\nthe Don would object to something but he’ll object to you \\ndirect if he docs. But 1 can’t imagine what that would be. \\nMovies don’t affect him at all, in any way, so he has no intetest. \\nAnd he doesn’t believe in meddling, that I can tell you from \\nexperience.’ \\n\\n‘Good/ Johnny said, ‘I’ll drive you to the airport myself. \\nAnd thank the Godfather for me. I’d call him up and thank \\nhim but he never comes to the phone. Why is that, by the \\nway?’ \\n\\nHagen shrugged. ‘He hardly ever talks on the phone. He \\ndoesn’t want his voice recorded, even saying something \\nperfectly innocent. He’s afraid that they can splice the words \\ntogether so that it sounds as if he says something else. 1 think \\nthat’s what it is. Anyway his only worry is that someday he’ll \\nbe framed by the authorities. So he doesn’t want to give them \\nan edge.’ \\n\\nThey got into Johnny’s car and drove to the airport. Hagen \\nwas thinking that Johnny was a better guy than he figured. \\nHe’d already learned something, just his driving him per- \\nsonally to the airport proved that. The personal courtesy, \\nsomething the Don himself always believed in. And the \\napology. That had been sincere. He had known Johnny a long \\ntime and he knew the apology would never be made out of \\nfeat. Johnny had always had guts. That’s why he had always \\nbeen in trouble, with his movie bosses and with his women. \\nHe was also one of the few people who was not afraid of the \\nDon. Fontane and Michael were maybe the only two men \\nHagen knew of whom this could be said. So the apology was \\nsincere, he would accept it as such. He and Johnqy would have \\nto sec a lot of each oihet in the next few years. And Johnny \\nwould have to pass the next test, which would prove how \\nsmart he was. He would have to do something for the Don \\nthat the Don would never ask him to do or insist that he do as \\npart of the agreement. Hagen wondered if Johnny Fontane \\nwas smart enough to figure out that part of the bargain. \\n\\nAfter Johnny dropped Hagen off at the airport (Hagen \\ninsisted that Johnny not hang around for his plane with bim) \\n\\n\\n*75 \\n\\n\\n\\nhe drove back to Glnny\\'a house. She was surprised to see him. \\nBut he wanted to stay at her place so that he would have time \\nto think things out, to make his plans. He knew that what \\nHagen had told him was extremely important, that his whole \\nlife was being changed. He had once been a big star but now at \\nthe young age of thirty-five he was washed up. He didn’t kid \\nhimself about that. Even if he won the Award as best actor, \\nwhat the hell could it mean at the most? Nothing, if his voice \\ndidn’t come back. He’d be just second-rate, with no real \\npower, no real juice. Even that girl turning him down, she had \\nbeen nice and smart and acting sort of hip, but would she have \\nbeen so cool if he had really been at the top? Now with the \\nDon backing him with dough he could be as big as anybody in \\nHollywood. He could be a king. Johnny smiled. Hell. He \\ncould even be a Don. \\n\\nIt would be nice living with Giony again for a few weeks, \\nmaybe longer. He’d take the kids out every day, maybe have a \\nfew friends over. He’d stop drinking and smoking, really take \\ncare of himself. Maybe his voice would get strong again. If \\nthat happened and with the Don’s money, he’d be unbeatable. \\nHe’d really be as close to an old-time king or emperor as it \\nwas possiNe to be in America. And it wouldn’t depend on his \\nvoice holding up or how long the public cared about him as an \\nactor. It would be an empire rooted in money and the most \\nspecial, the most coveted kind of power. \\n\\nGinny had the guest bedroom made up for him. It was \\nunderstood that he would not share her room, that they would \\nnot live as man and wife. They could never have that teladon- \\nship again. And though the outside world of gossip columnists \\nand n^ovie fims gave the blame for the failure of their marriage \\nsolely to him, yet in a curious way, between the two of them, \\nthey both knew that she was even more to blame for their \\ndivorce. \\n\\nWhen Johnny Fontane became the most popular singer and \\nmovie musical comedy star in motion pictures, it had never \\noccurred to him to desert his wife and children. He was too \\nItalian, sdll too old-style. Naturally he had been unfiuthful. \\nThat had been impossible to avoid in his business and the \\ntemptations to which he was continually exposed. And de fitf \\n\\n176 \\n\\n\\n\\nbeing a skinny, delicate-looking guy, he had the wiry hotoi- \\nness of many small-boned Latin types. And women delighted \\nhim in their surprises. He loved going out with a demure \\nsweet-faced virginal-looking girl and then uncapping her \\nbreasts to find them so unexpectedly slopingly full and rich, \\nlewdly heavy in contrast to the cameo face. He loved to find \\nsexual shyness and timidity in the sexy-looking girls who were \\nall fake motion like a shifty basketball player, vamping as if \\nthey had slept with a hundred guys, and then when he got \\nthem alone having to battle for hours to get in and do the job \\nand finding out they were virgins. \\n\\nAnd all these Hollywood guys laughed at his fondness for \\nvirgins. They called it an old guinea taste, square, and look \\nhow long it took to make a virgin give you a blow job with all \\nthe aggravation and then they usually turned out to be a lousy \\npiece of ass. But Johnny knew that it was how you handled a \\nyoung girl. You had to come or to her the right way and then \\nwhat could be greater than a girl who was tasting her first \\ndick and loving it? Ah, it was so great breaking them in. It \\nwas so great having them wrap their legs around you. Their \\nthighs were all different shapes, their asses were different, their \\nskins were all different colours and shades of white and brown \\nand tan and when he had slept with that young coloured girl \\nin Detroit, a good girl, not a hustler, the young daughter of a \\njstzz singer on the same nightclub bill with him, she had been \\none of ^e sweetest things he had ever had. Her lips had really \\ntasted like warm honey with pepper mixed in it, her dark \\nbrown skin was rich, creamy, and she had been as sweet as \\nGod had ever made any woman and she had been a virgin. \\n\\nAnd the other guys were always talking abouj: blow jobs \\nthis and other variations and he re^y didn’t enjoy that stuff so \\nmuch. He never liked a girl that much after they tried it that \\nway, it just didn’t satisfy him right. He and his second wife \\nhad finally not got along because she preferred the old sixty- \\nnine too much to a point where she didn’t want anything else \\nand he had to fight to stick it in. She began making fun of him \\nand calling him a square and the word got around that he \\nmade love like a kid. Maybe that was why that girl last night \\nhad turned him down. Well, the hell with it, she wouldn’t be \\n\\n\\n*77 \\n\\n\\n\\ntoo great in the sack anyway. You could tell a girl who really \\nliked to fuck and they were always the best. Especially the \\nones who hadn’t been at it too long. What he really hated were \\nthe ones who had started screwing at twelve and were all \\nfucked out by the time they were twenty and just going \\nthrough the motions and some of them were the prettiest of \\nall and could fake you out. \\n\\nGinny brought coffee and cake into his bedroom and put it \\non the long table in the sitting room part. He told her simply \\nthat Hagen was helping him put together the money credit for \\na producing package and she was excited about that. He \\nwould be important again. But she had no idea of how power- \\nful Don Corleone really was so she didn’t understand the \\nsignificance of Hagen coming from New York. He told her \\nHagen was also helping with legal details. \\n\\nWhen they had finished the coffee he told her he was going \\nto work that night, and make phone calls and plans for the \\nfuture. ‘Half of all this will be in the kids’ names,’ he told her. \\nShe gave him a grateful smile and kissed him goodnight \\nbefore she left his room. \\n\\nThere was a glass dish full of his favourite monogrammed \\ncigarettes, a humidor with pencil-thin black Cuban cigars on \\nhis writing desk. Johnny tilted back and started making calls. \\nHis brain was really whirring along. He called the author of \\nthe book, the best-selling novel, on which his new film was \\nbased. The author was a guy his own age who had come up the \\nhard way and was now a celebrity in the literary world. He had \\ncome out to flollywood expecting to be treated like a wheel \\nand, like most authors, had been treated like shit. Johnny had \\nseen the humiliation of the author one night at the Brown \\nDerby. The writer had been fixed up with a well-known \\n< bosomy starlet for a date on the town and a sure shack-up later. \\nBut while they were at dinner the starlet had deserted the famous \\nauthor because a ratty-looking movie comic had waggled his \\nfinger at her. That had given the writer the right slant on just \\nwho was who in the Hollywood pecking order. It didn’t matter \\nthat his book had made him world famous,. A starlet would \\nprefer the crummiest, the rattiest, the phoniest movie wheel. \\n\\nNow Johnny called the author at his New York home to \\n\\n178 \\n\\n\\n\\nthank him for the great part he had written in his book for \\nhim. He flattered the shit out of the guy. Then casually he \\nasked him how he was doing on his next novel and what it was \\nall about. He lit a cigar while the author told him about a \\nspecially interesting chapter and then finally said, ‘Gee, I*d \\nlike to read it when you’re finished. How about sending me a \\ncopy ? Maybe I can get you a good deal for it, better than you \\ngot with Woltz.’ \\n\\nThe eagerness in the author’s voice told him that he had \\nguessed right. Woltz had chiselled the guy, given him peanuts \\nfor the book. Johnny mentioned that he might be in New \\nYork right after the holidays and would the author want to \\ncome and have dinner with some of his friends. ‘I know a few \\ngood-looking broads,* Johnny said jokingly. The author \\nlaughed and said OK. \\n\\nNext Johnny ^called up the director and cameraman on the \\nfilm he had just finished to thank them for having helped him \\nin the film. He told them confidentially that he knew Woltz \\nhad been against him and he doubly appreciated their help and \\nthat if there was ever anything he could do for them they \\nshould just call. \\n\\n\\'Fhen he made the hardest call of all, the one to Jack Woltz. \\nHe thanked him for the part in the picture and told him how \\nhappy he would be to work for him any time. He did this \\nmerely to throw Woltz off the track. He had always been very \\nsquare, very straight. In a few days Woltz would find out \\nabout this manoeuvring and be astounded by the treachery of \\nthis call, which was exactly what Johnny Fontane wanted him \\nto feel. \\n\\nAfter that he sat at the desk and puffed at his cigar. There \\nwas whisky on a side table but he had made some sort of \\npromise to himself and Hagen that he wouldn’t drink. He \\nshouldn’t even be smoking. It was foolish; whatever was \\nwrong with his voice probably wouldn’t be helped by knock- \\ning off drinking and smoking. Not too much, but what the \\nhell, it might help and he wanted all the percentages with him, \\nnow that he had a fighting chance. \\n\\nNow with the house quiet, his divorced wife sleeping, his \\nbeloved daughters sleeping, he could think back to that \\n\\n\\n*79 \\n\\n\\n\\ntetfible time in his life when he had deserted them. Deserted \\nthem for a whore tramp of a bitch who was his second wife. \\nBut even now he smiled at the thought of her, she was such a \\nlovely broad in so many ways and, besides, the only thing that \\nsaved his life was the day that he had made up his mind never \\nto hate a woman or, more specifically, the day he had decided \\nhe could not afford to hate his first wife and his daughters, his \\ngirlfriends, his second wife, and the girlfriends after that, \\nlight up to Sharon Moore brushing him off so that she could \\nhtSLg about refusing to screw for the great Johnny Fontane. \\n\\nHe had travelled with the band singing and then he had \\nbecome a radio star and a star of the movie stage shows and \\nthen he had finally made it in the movies. And in all that time \\nhe had lived the way he wanted to, screwed the women he \\nwanted to, but4ie had never let it affe^ his personal life. Then \\nhe had fallen for his soon-to-be second wife, Margot Ashton; \\nhe had gone absolutely crazy for her. His career had gone to \\nhell, his voice had gone to h^, his fiuxiily life had gone to hell. \\nAnd there had come the day when he was left without \\nanything. \\n\\nThe thing was, he had always been generous and fair. He \\nhad given his first wife everything he owned when be di- \\nvorced her. He had made sure his. two daughters would get a \\npiece of everything he made, every record, every movie, every \\ndub date. And when he had been rich and famous he had \\nrefused his first wife nothing. He had helped out aU her \\nbrothers and sisters, her father and mother, the girlfriends \\nshe had gone to school with and their families. He had never \\nbeen a stuck-up celebnty. He had sung at the weddings of his \\nwife’s two younger sisters, something he hated to do. He had \\nnever refused her anything except the complete surrender of \\nhis own personality. \\n\\nAnd then when he had touched bottom, when he could no \\nlonger get movie work, when he could no longer sing, when \\nhis second wife had betrayed him, he had gone to spend a few \\ndays with Ginny and his ^ughters. He had more or less flung \\nhimself on her mercy one night because he felt so lousy. That \\nday he had heard one of his recordings and he had sounded so \\n\\ni8o \\n\\n\\n\\nterrible that he accused the sound technidaiis of sabotuging \\nthe record. Until finally he had become convinced tibat that \\nwas what his voice really sounded like. He had smashed the \\nmaster record and refused to sing any more. He was so ashamed \\nthat he had not sung a note except with Nino at Connie \\nCorleone’s wedding. \\n\\nHe had never forgotten the look on Ginny^s face when she \\nfound out about all his misfortunes. It had passed over her \\nface only for a second but that was enough for him never to \\nforget it. It was a look of savage and joyful satisfaction. It was \\na look that could only make him believe that she had contemp- \\ntuously hated him all these years. She quickly recovered and \\noffered him cool but polite sympathy. He had pretended to \\naccept it. During the next few days he had gone to see three of \\nthe gills he had liked the most over the years, girls he had \\nremained friends with and sometimes st^ slept with in a \\ncomradely way, gkls that he had done everything in his power \\nto help, girls to whom he had given the equivalent of hundreds \\nof thousands of dollars in gifts or job opportunities. On their \\nfaces he had* caught that same fleeting look of savage satis- \\nfaction. \\n\\nIt was during that time that he knew he had to make a \\ndecision. He could become like a great many other men in \\nHoll3rwood, successful producers, writers, directors, actors, \\nwho preyed on beautiful women with lustful hatred. He could \\nuse power and monetary favours grudgingly, always alert \\nfor treason, always believing that women would betray and \\ndesert him, adversaries to be bested. Or he could refuse to hate \\nwomen and continue to believe in them. \\n\\nHe knew he could not afford not to love them, that some- \\nthing of his spirit would die if he did not continue to love \\nwomen no matter how treacherous and unfidthful they ware. \\nIt didn’t matter that the women he loved most in the world \\nwere secretly glad to see him crushed, humiliated, by a way- \\nward fortune ; it did not matter that in the most awful way, not \\nsexually, they had been unfaithful to him. He had no choice. \\nHe had to accept them. And so he made love to all of them, \\ngave them presents, hid the hurt their enjoyment of his mis- \\nfortunes gave him. He forgave them knowing he was being \\n\\ni8i \\n\\n\\n\\npaid back for having lived in the utmost freedom from women \\nand in the fullest flush of their flavour. But now he never felt \\nguilty about being untrue to them. He never felt guilty about \\nhow he treated Ginny, insisting on remaining the sole father \\nof his children, yet never even considering remarrying her, \\nand letting her know that too. That was one thing he had \\nsalvaged out of his fall from the top. He had grown a thick \\nskin about the hurts he gave women. \\n\\nHe was tired and ready for bed but one note of memory \\nstuck with him: singing with Nino Valenti. And suddenly he \\nknew what would please Don Corleone more than anything \\nelse. He picked up the phone and told the operator to get him \\nNew York. He called Sonny Corleone and asked him for \\nNino Valenti’s number. Then he called Nino. Nino sounded a \\nlittle drunk as usual. \\n\\n‘ Hey, Nino, how’d you like to come out here and work for \\nme,’ Johnny said. ‘I need a guy I can trust.’ \\n\\nNino, kidding arotind, said, ‘Gee, I don’t know, Johnny, I \\ngot a good job on the truck, bofling housewives along my \\nroute, picking up a clear hundred-fifty every week. What you \\ngot tO\\' offer?* \\n\\n* 1 can start you at five hundred and get you blind dates with \\nmovie stars, how’s that?’ Johnny said. \\'And maybe I’ll let you \\nsing at my parties.’ \\n\\n‘ Yeah, OK, let me think about it,’ Nino said. \\'Let me talk it \\nover with my lawyer and my accountant and my helper on the \\ntruck.’ \\n\\n‘Hey, no kidding around, Nino,’ Johnny said. \\'I need you \\nout here. I want you to fly out tomorrow morning and sign a \\npersonal contract for five hundred a week for a year. Then if \\nyou steal one of my broads and I fire you, you pick up at least a \\nyear’s salary. OK?’ \\n\\nThere was a long pause. Nino’s voice was sober. ‘Hey, \\nJohnny, you kidding?’ \\n\\nJohnny said, ‘I’m serious, kid. Go to my agent’s office in \\nNew York. They’ll have your plane ticket and some cash. I’m \\ngonna call them first thing in the morning. So you go up there \\nin the afternoon. OK? Then I’ll have somebody meet you at \\nthe plane and bring you out to the house.’ \\n\\n182 \\n\\n\\n\\nAgain there was a long pause and then Ninons voice, very \\nsubdued, uncertain, said, ‘OK, Johnny/ He didn’t sound \\ndrunk any more. \\n\\nJohnny hung up the phone and got ready for bed. He felt \\nbetter than any time since he had smashed that master record. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN \\n\\n\\njoHNNYFoNTANKsatin the huge recording studio and figured \\ncosts on a yellow pad. Musicians were filing in, all of them \\nfriends he had known since he was a kid singer with the \\nbands. The conductor, top man in the business of pop accom- \\npaniment and a man who had been kind to him when things \\nwent sour, was giving each musician bundles of music and \\nverbal instructions. His name was Eddie Neils. He had taken \\non this recording as a favour to Johnny, though his schedule \\nwas crowded. \\n\\nNino Valenti was sitting at a piano fooling around ner- \\nvously with the keys. He was also sipping from a huge glass of \\nrye. Johnny didn’t mind that. He knew Nino sang just as well \\ndrunk as sober and what they were doing today wouldn’t \\nrequire any real musicianship on Nino\\'s part. \\n\\nEddie Neils had made special arrangements of some old \\nItalian and Sicilian songs, and a special job on the duel-duet \\nsong that Nino and Johnny had sung at Connie Corleone’s \\nwedding. Johnny was making the record primarily because he \\nknew that the Don loved such songs and it would be a perfect \\nChristmas, gift for him. He also had a hunch that the record \\nwould sell in the high numbers, not a million, of course. And \\nhe had figured out that helping Nino was how the Don wanted \\nhis payoff. Nino was, after all, another one of the Don\\'s god- \\nchildren. \\n\\nJohnny put his clipboard and yellow pad on the folding \\nchair beside him and got up to stand beside the piano. He said, \\n‘Hey, paisan* and Nino glanced up and tried to smile. He \\nlooked a little sick. Johnny leaned over and rubbed his \\n\\n183 \\n\\n\\n\\nshoulder blades. *Relax, kid,* he said. ‘Do a good job today \\nand rii fix you up with the best and most famous piece of ass \\nill Hollywood.’ \\n\\nNino took a gulp of whisky. ‘Who’s that. Lassie?’ \\n\\nJohnny laughed. ‘No, Deanna Dunn. I guarantee the \\ngoods.* \\n\\nNino was impressed but couldn’t help saying with pseudo- \\nhopefulness, ‘You can’t get me Lassie?’ \\n\\nThe orchestra swung into the opening song of the medley. \\nJohnny Fontane listened intently. Eddie Neils would play all \\nthe songs through in their special arrangements. Then would \\ncome the first take for the record. As Johnny listened he made \\nmental notes on exactly how he would handle each phrase, \\nhow he would come into each song. He knew his voice \\nwouldn’t last long, but Nino would be doing most of the \\nsinging, Johnny would be singing under him. Except of \\ncourse in the duet-duel song. He would have to save himself \\nfor that. \\n\\nHe pulled Nino to his feet and they both stood by their \\nmicrophones. Nino flubbed the opening, flubbed it again. His \\nface was beginning to get red with embarrassment. Johnny \\nkidded him, ‘Hey, you stalling for overtime?’ \\n\\n‘I don’t feel natund without my mandolin,’ Nino said. \\n\\nJohnny thought that over for a moment. ‘Hold that glass of \\nhoo 2 c in your hand,’ he said. \\n\\nIt seemed to do the trick. Nino kept drinking from the glass \\nas he sang but he was doing fine. Johnny sang easily, not \\nstraining, his voice merely dancing around Nino’s main \\nmelody. There was no emotional satis^ction in this kind of \\nsinging but he was amazed at his own technical skill. Ten \\nyears of vocalizing had taught him something. \\n\\nWhen, they came to the duet-duel song that ended the \\nrecord, Johnny let his voice go and when they finished his \\nvocal chords ached. The musicians had been carried away by \\nthe last song, a rare thing for these calloused veterans. They \\nhammered down their instruments and 8tanq>ed their feet in \\napproval as applause. The drummer gave diem a ruffle of \\ndnims. \\n\\nWith stops and conferences they worked nearly four hours \\n\\n184 \\n\\n\\n\\nbefore they quit. Eddie Neils came over to Johnny and said \\nquietly, ‘You sounded pretty good, kid. Maybe you’re ready to \\ndo a record. I have a new song that’s perfect for you.’ \\n\\nJohnny shook his head. ‘Come on, Eddie, don’t kid me. \\nBesides in a couple of hours I’ll be too hoarse to even talk. Do \\nyou think we’ll have to fix up much of the stuff we did today?* \\n\\nEddie said thoughtfully, ‘Nino will have to come into the \\nstudio tomorrow. He made some mistakes. But he’s much \\nbetter than 1 thought he would be. As for your stuff. I’ll have \\nthe sound engineers fix anything I don’t like. OK?’ \\n\\n‘OK,’ Jolmny said. ‘When can I hear the pressing?’ \\n\\n‘Tomorrow night,’ Eddie Neils said. ‘Your place?’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Johnny said. ‘Thanks, Eddie. See you tomorrow.’ \\nHe took Nino by the arm and walked out of the studio. They \\nwent to his house instead of Ginny’s. \\n\\nBy this time it was late afternoon. Nino was still more than \\nhalf-drunk. Johnny told him to get under the shower and \\nthen take a snooze. They had to be at a big party at eleven that \\nnight. \\n\\nWhen Nino woke up, Johnny briefed him. ‘This party is a \\nmovie star Lonely Hearts Qub,’ he said. ‘These broads to- \\nnight are dames you’ve seen in the movies as glamour queens \\nmillions of guys would give their right arms to screw. And the \\nonly reason they’ll be at the party tonight is to find somebody \\nto shack them up. Do you know why? Because they are \\nhungry for it, they are just a little old. And just like every \\ndame, they want it with a little bit of class.’ \\n\\n‘ What\\'s the matter with your voice ? ’ Nino asked. \\n\\nJohnny had been speaking almost in a whisper. ‘Every \\ntime after 1 sing a little bit that happens. 1 won’t be able to \\nsing for a month now. But I’ll get over the hoarseness in a \\ncouple of days.’ \\n\\nNino said thoughtfully, ‘Tough, huh?’ \\n\\nJohnny shrugged. ‘Listen, Nino, don’t get too drunk to- \\nnight. You have to show these Hollywood broads that my \\npaisan buddy ain’t weak in the poop. You gotta come across. \\nRemember, some of these dames are very powerful in movies,, \\nthey can get you work. It doesn’t hurt to be charming after \\nyou knock off a piece.’ \\n\\n\\n185 \\n\\n\\n\\nNino was already pouring himself a diink. always \\ncharming/ he said. He drained the glass. Grinning, he asked. \\n‘No kidding, can you really get me close to Deanna Dunn?’ \\n\\n‘Don’t be so anxious/ Johnny said. ‘It’s not going to be \\nlike you think.’ \\n\\nThe Hollywood Movie Star Lonely Hearts Club (so called \\nby the young juvenile leads whose attendance was mandatory) \\nmet every Friday night at the palatial, studio-owned home of \\nRoy McElroy, press agent or rather public relations counsel \\nfor the Woltz International Film Corporation. Actually, \\nthough it was McElroy’s open house party, the idea had come \\nfrom the practical brain of Jack Woltz himself. Some of his \\nmoney-making movie stars were getting older now. Without \\nthe help of special lights and genius makeup men they looked \\ntheir age. They were having problems. They had also become, \\nto some extent, desensitized physically and mentally. They \\ncould no longer ‘fall in love’. They could no longer assume \\nthe role of hunted women. They had been made too imperious; \\nby money, by fame, by their former beauty, Woltz gave his \\nparties so that it would be easier for them to pick up lovers, \\none-night stands, who, if they had the stuff, could graduate \\ninto full-time bed partners and so work their way upward. \\nSince the action sometimes degenerated into brawls or sexual \\nexcess that led to trouble with the police, Woltz decided to \\nhold the parties in the house of the public relations counsellor, \\nwho would be right there to fix things up, pay off newsmen \\nand police officers and keep everything quiet. \\n\\nFor certain virile young male actors on the studio payroll \\nwho had not yet achieved stardom or featured roles, atten- \\ndance at the Friday night parties was a not always pleasant \\nduty. This was explained by the fact that a new film yet to be \\nreleased by the studio would be shown at the party. In fact that \\nwas the excuse for the party itself. People would say, ‘Let’s go \\nover to see what the new picture so and so made is like.’ And \\nso it was put in a professional context. \\n\\nYoung female starlets were forbidden to attend the Friday \\nnight parties. Or rather discouraged. Most of them took the \\nhint. \\n\\n\\ni86 \\n\\n\\n\\nScreenings of the new movies took place at midnight and \\njohnny and Nino arrived at eleven. Roy McElroy proved to \\nbe, at first sight, an enormously likeable man, well-groomed, \\nbeautifully dressed. He greeted Johnny Fontane with a sur- \\nprised cry of delight. *What the hell are you doing here?* he \\nsaid with genuine astonishment. \\n\\nJohnny shook his hand. ‘I’m showing my country cousin \\nthe sights. Meet Nino.’ \\n\\nMcElroy shook hands with Nino and gazed at him ap- \\npraisingly. ‘They’ll eat him up alive/ he said to Johnny. He \\nled them to the rear patio. \\n\\nThe rear patio was really a series of huge rooms whose glass \\ndoors had been opened to a garden and pool. There were \\nalmost a hundred people milling around, all with drinks in \\ntheir hands. The patio lighting was artfully arranged to flatter \\nfeminine faces and skin. These were women Nino had seen on \\nthe darkened movie screens when he had been a teenager. \\nThey had played their part in his erotic dreams of adolescence. \\nBut seeing them now in the flesh was like seeing them in some \\nhorrible makeup. Nothing could hide the tiredness of their \\nspirit and their flesh; time had eroded their godhead. They \\nposed and moved as charmingly as he remembered but they \\nwere like wax fruit, they could not lubricate his glands. Nino \\ntook two drinks, wandered to a table where he could stand \\nnext to a nest of bottles. Johnny moved with him. They drank \\ntogether until behind them came the magic voice of Deanna \\nDunn. \\n\\nNino, like millions of other men, had that voice imprinted on \\nhis brain forever. Deanna Dunn had won two Academy \\nAwards, had been in the biggest movie grosser made in Holly- \\nwood. On the screen she had a feline feminine \\'charm that \\nmade her irresistible to all men. But the words she was saying \\nhad never been heard on the silver screen. ‘Johnny, you \\nbastard, I had to go to my psychiatrist again because you gave \\nme a one-night stand. How come you never came back for \\nseconds?’ \\n\\nJohnny kissed her on her proflered cheek. ‘You wore me \\nout for a month,’ he said. ‘ I want you to meet my cousin Nino. \\nA nice strong Italian boy. Maybe he can keep up with you.’ \\n\\n187 \\n\\n\\n\\nDeanna Dunn turned to give Nino a cool look. ‘Does he \\nlike to watch previews?’ \\n\\nJohnny laughed. don’t think he’s ever had the chance. \\nWhy don’t you break him in?’ \\n\\nNino had to take a big drink when he was alone with \\nDeanna Dunn. He was trying to be nonchalant but it was hard. \\nDeanna Dunn had the upturned nose, the clean-^nit classical \\nfeatures of the AnglchSazon beauty. And he knew her so well. \\nHe had seen her alone in a bedroom, heartbroken, weeping \\nover her dead diet husband who had left her with fatherless \\nchildren. He had seen her angry, hurt, humiliated, yet with a \\nshining dignity when a caddish Qark Gable had taken ad- \\nvantage of her, then left her for a scxpot. (Deanna Dunn never \\nplayed sexpots in the movies.) He had seen her flushed with \\nrequited love, writhing in the embrace of the man she adored \\nand he had seen her die beautifully at least a half dozen times. \\nHe had seen her and heard her and dreamed about her and yet \\nhe was not prepared for the first thing she said to him alone. \\n\\n‘Johnny is one of the few men with balls in this town,’ she \\nsaid. ‘The rest are all fags and sick morons who couldn’t get h \\nup with a broad if you pumped a truckload of Spanish fly into \\ntheir scrotums.’ She took Nino by the hand and led him into a \\ncomer of the room, out of traflic and out of competition. \\n\\nThen still coolly charming, she asked him about himself. He \\nsaw through her. He saw that she was playing the role of the \\nrich society girl who is being kind to the stableboy or the \\nchauffeur, but who in the movie would either discourage his \\namatory interest (if the part were played by Spencer Tracy), or \\nthrow up everything in her mad desire for him (if the part were \\nplayed by Qark Gable). But it didn’t matter. He found himself \\ntellMg her about how he and Johnny had grown up together \\nin New York, about how he and Johnny had sung together on \\nlittle club dates. He found her marvellously sympathetic and \\ninterested. Once she asked casually, ‘Do you know how \\nJohnny made that bastard Jack Woltz give him the part?’ \\nNino froze and shook his head. She didn’t pursue it. \\n\\nThe time had come to see the preview of a new Woltz \\nmovie. Deanna Dunn led Nino, her warm hand imprisoning \\nhis, to an interior room of the mansion that had no windows \\n\\n\\ni88 \\n\\n\\n\\nbot was fu rni s h ed with about fifty stuaU two-petson couches \\nscattered around in such a way as to give es^ one a little \\nisland of semiprivacy. \\n\\nNino saw there was a smaU table beside the couch and on \\nthe table were an ice bowl, glasses, and bottles of liquor plus a \\ntray of cigarettes. He gave Deanna Dunn a cigarette, lit it and \\nthen mixed them both drinks. They didn’t speak to each other. \\nAfter a few minutes the lights went out. \\n\\nHe had been expecting something outrageous. After all, he \\nhad heard the legends of Hollywood depravity. But he was not \\nquite prepared for Deanna Dunn’s voracious plummet on his \\nsexual organ without even a courteous and friendly word of \\npreparation. He kept sipping his drink and watching the \\nmode, but not tasting, not seeing. He was excited in a way he \\nhad never been before but part of it was because this woman \\nservicing him in the dark had been the object of his adolescent \\ndreams. \\n\\nYet in a way his masculinity was insulted. So when the \\nworld-famous Deanna Dunn was sated and had tidied him up, \\nhe very coolly fixed her a fresh drink in the darkness and Ik her \\na fresh cigarette and said in the most relaxed voice imaginable, \\n‘This looks like a pretty good movie.’ \\n\\nHe felt her stilfen beside him on the couch. Could it be she \\nwas waiting for some sort of compliment? Nino poured his \\nglass full from the nearest bottle his hand touched in die \\ndarkness. The hell with that. She’d treated him like a god- \\ndamn male whore. For some reason now he felt a cold anger \\nat all these women. They watched the picture for another \\nfifteen minutes. He leaned away from her so their bodies did \\nnot touch. \\n\\nFinally she said in a low harsh whisper, ‘Don’t be such a \\nsnotty punk, you liked it. You were as big as a house.’ \\n\\nNino sipped his drink and said in natural off-hand \\nmanner, ‘That’s the way it always is. You should see it when I \\nget excited.’ \\n\\nShe laughed a little and kept quiet for the rest of the picture. \\nFinally it was over and the lights w^nt on. Nino took a look \\naround. He could sec there had been a ball here in the darkness \\nthough oddly enough he hadn’t heard a thing. But some of the \\n\\n189 \\n\\n\\n\\ndames had that hard, shiny, bright-eyed look of women who \\nhad just been worked over real good. They sauntered out of \\nthe projection room. Deanna Dunn left him immediately to go \\nover and talk to an older man Nino recognized as a famous \\nfeatured player, only now, seeing the guy in person, he \\nrealized that he was a fag. He sipped his drink thoughtfully. \\n\\nJohnny Fontane came up ^side him and said, ‘Hi, old \\nbuddy, having a good time?’ \\n\\nNino grinned. ‘I don’t know. It’s different. Now when I go \\nback to the old neighbourhood 1 can say Deanna Dunn had \\nme.* \\n\\nJohnny laughed. ‘She can be better than that if she invites \\nyou home with her. Did she?* \\n\\nNino shook his head. ‘1 got too interested in the movie,’ he \\nsaid. But this time Johnny didn’t laugh. \\n\\n‘ Get serious, kid,’ he said. ‘A dame like that can do you a lot \\nof good. And you used to boff anything. Man, sometimes I still \\nget nightmares when I remember those ugly broads you used \\nto bang.’ \\n\\nNino waved his glass drunkenly and said very loud, ‘Yeah, \\nthey were ugly but they were women.* Deanna Dunn, in the \\ncorner, turned her head to look at them. Nino waved his glass \\nat her in greeting. \\n\\nJohnny Fontane sighed. *OK, you’re just a guinea peasant.\\' \\n\\n‘And 1 ain’t gonna change,’ Nino said with his charmingly \\ndrunken smile. \\n\\nJohnny understood him perfectly. He knew Nino was not as \\ndrunk as he pretended. He knew that Nino was only pretend- \\ning so that he could say things which he felt were too rude to \\nsay to his new Hollywood padrone when sober. He put his arm \\naround Nino’s neck and said affectionately, ‘You wise guy \\nbum, you know you got an ironclad contract for a year and \\nyou can say and do anything you want and I can’t fire you.’ \\n\\n‘You can’t fire me?’ Nino said with drunken cunning. \\n\\n‘No,* Johnny said. \\n\\n‘Then fuck you,’ Nino said. \\n\\nFor a moment Johnny was surprised into anger. He saw the \\ncareless grin on Nino’s face. But in the past few years he must \\nhave got smarter, or his own descent from stardom had \\n\\n\\n190 \\n\\n\\n\\nmade him more sensitive. In that moment he understood Nino, \\nwhy his boyhood singing partner had never become successful, \\nwhy he was trying to destroy any chance of success now. That \\nNino was reacting away from all the prices of success, that in \\nsome way he felt insulted by everything that was being done \\nfor him. \\n\\nJohnny took Nino by the arm and led him out of the house. \\nNino could barely walk now. Johnny was talking to him \\nsoothingly. ‘OK, kid, you just sing for me, I wanta make \\ndough on you. I won\\'t try to run your life. You do whatever \\nyou wanta do. OK, pMsan? All you gotta do is sing for me anc^ \\nearn me money now that 1 can\\'t sing any more. You got that, \\nold buddy?’ \\n\\nNino straightened up. ‘I’ll sing for you, Johnny,’ he said, \\nhis voice slurring so that he could barely be understood. ‘ I’m \\na better singer than you now. I was always a better singer than \\nyou, you know that?’ \\n\\nJohnny stood there thinking; so that was it. He knew that \\nwhen his voice was healthy Nino simply wasn’t in the same \\nleague with him, never had been in those years they had sung \\ntogether as kids. He saw Nino was waiting for an answer, \\nweaving drunkenly in the California moonlight. ‘Fuck you,’ \\nhe said gently, and they both laughed together like the old days \\nwhen they had both been equally young. \\n\\nWhen Johnny Fontane got word about the shooting of Don \\nCorleone he not only worried about his Godfather, but also \\nwondered whether the financing for his movie was still alive. \\nHe had wanted to go to New York to pay his respects to his \\nGodfather in the hospital but he had been told not to get any \\nbad publicity, that was the last thing Don Corleone would \\nwant. So he waited. A week later a messenget came from Tom \\nHagen. The financing was still on but for only one picture at a \\ntime. \\n\\nMeanwhile Johnny let Nino go his own way in Hollywood \\nand California, and Nino was doing all right with the young \\nstarlets. Sometimes Johnny called him up for a night out to> \\ngether but never leaned on him. When they talked about the \\nDon getting shot, Nino said to Johnny, ‘You know, once 1 \\n\\n\\n191 \\n\\n\\n\\nasked the Don for a job in his organmtion and he wouldn’t \\ngive it to me. 1 was tired of driving a truck and 1 wanted to \\nmake a lot of dough. You know what he told me? He says \\nevery man has only one destiny and that my destiny was to be \\nan artist. Meaning that 1 couldn’t be a racket guy.’ \\n\\nJohnny thought that one ovtstl The Godfather must be just \\nabout the smartest guy in the world. He’d known imme- \\ndiately that Nino could never make a racket guy, would only \\nget himself in trouble or get killed. Get killed with just one of \\nhis wisecracks. But how did the Don know that he would be \\nan artist? Because, goddamn it, he figured that someday I’d \\nhelp Nino. And how did he figure that? Because he wotild \\ndrop the word to me and I would try to show my gratitude. \\nOf course he never asked me to do it. He just let me know it \\nwould make him happy if I did it. Johnny Fontane sighed. \\nNow the Godfather was hurt, in trouble, and he could kiss the \\nAcademy Award goodbye with Woltz working against him \\nand no help on his side. Only the Don had the personal con- \\ntacts that could apply pressure and the Corleone Family had \\nother things to think about. Johnny had ofiered to help, Hagen \\nhad given him a curt no. \\n\\nJohimy was busy getting his own picture going. The author \\nof the book he had starred in had finished his new novel and \\n\"came west on Johnny’s invitation, to talk it over without \\nagents or studios getting into the act. The second book was \\nperfect for what Johnny wanted. He wouldn’t have to sing, it \\nhad a good gutsy story with plenty of dames and sex and it \\nhad a part that Johimy instantly recognized as tailor-made for \\nNino. The character talked like Nino, acted like him, even \\nlooked like him. It was uncanny. All Nino would have to do \\nwould be to get up on the screen and be himself. \\n\\nJohnny worked fast. He found that he knew a lot more \\nabout production than he thought he did, but he hired an exe- \\ncutive producer, a man who knew his stuff but had trouble \\nfinding work because of the blacklist. Johnny didn’t take ad- \\nvantage but gave the man a fair contract. * I expect you to save \\nme more dough this way,’ he told the man frankly. \\n\\nSo he was surprised when the executive producer came to \\nhim and told him the union rep had to be taken care of to die \\n\\n\\n191 \\n\\n\\n\\ntune of fifty thousand dollars. There were a lot of problems \\ndealing with overtime and hiring and the fifty thousand \\ndollars would be well spent. Johnny debated whethei the \\nexecutive producer was husding him and then said, ‘ Send the \\nunion guy to me.’ \\n\\nThe union guy was Billy Goffl Johnny said to him, ‘I \\nthought the union stuff was i^ed by my friends. I was told not \\nto worry about it. At all.’ \\n\\nGoff said, ‘Who told you that?’ \\n\\nJohnny said, ‘You know goddamn well who told me. I \\nwon’t say bis name but if he tells me something that’s it.’ \\n\\nGoff said, ‘Things have changed. Your friend is in trouble \\nand his word don’t go this far west any more.’ \\n\\nJohnny shrugged. ‘See me in a couple of days. OK?’ \\n\\nGoff smiled. ‘Sure, Johnny,’ he said. ‘But calling in New \\nYork ain’t going to help you.’ \\n\\nBut calling New York did help. Johnny spoke to Hagen at \\nhis office. Hagen told him bluntly not to pay. ‘Your God- \\nfather will be sore as hell if you pay that bastard a dime,’ he \\ntold Johnny. ‘It will make the Don lose respect and right now \\nhe can’t afford that.’ \\n\\n‘Can I talk to the Don?’ Johnny asked. ‘Will you talk to \\nhim? I gotta get the picture rolling.’ \\n\\n‘Nobody can talk to the Don right now,’ Hagen said. ‘He’s \\ntoo sick. I’ll talk to Sonny about fixing things up. But I’ll make \\nthe decision on this. Don’t pay that smart bastard a dime. If \\nanything changes. I’ll let you know.’ \\n\\nAnnoyed, Johnny hung up. Union trouble could add a \\nfortune to making the film and screw up the works generally. \\nFor a moment he debated slipping Goff the fifty grand on the \\nquiet. After all, the Don telling him something and Hagen \\ntelling him something and giving him orders were two \\ndifferent things. But he decided to wait for a few days. \\n\\nBy waiting he saved fifty thousand dollars. Two nights \\nlater, Goff was found shot to death in his home in Glendale. \\nThere was no more talk of \\\\mion trouble. Johnny was a little \\nshaken by the killing. It was the first time the long arm of the \\nDon had struck such a lethal blow so dose to him. \\n\\nAs the weeks went by and he became busier and busier with \\n\\n*93 \\n\\nGodfather- 7 \\n\\n\\n\\ngetting the script ready, casting the movie, and working out \\nproduction details, Johnny Fontane forgot about his voice, his \\nnot being able to sing. Yet when the Academy Award nomi- \\nnations came out and he found himself one of the candidates, \\nhe was depressed because he was not asked to sing one of the \\nsongs nominated for the Oscar at the ceremony that would be \\ntelevised nationally. But he shrugged it oflF and kept working. \\nHe had no hope of winning the Academy Award now that his \\nGodfather was no longer able to put pressure on, but getting \\nthe nomination had some value. \\n\\nThe record he and Nino had cut, the one of Italian songs, \\nwas selling much better than anything he had cut lately, but he \\nknew that it was Nino’s success more than his. He resigned \\nhimself to never being able to again sing professionally. \\n\\nOnce a week he had dinner with Ginny and the kids. No \\nmatter how hectic things got he never skipped that duty. But \\nhe didn’t sleep with Ginny. Meanwhile his second wife had \\nhnagled a Mexican divorce and so he was a bachelor again. \\nOddly enough he was not that frantic to bang starlets who \\nwould have been easy meat. He was too snobbish really. He \\nwas hurt that none of the young stars, the actresses who were \\nstill on top, ever gave him a tumble. But it was good to work \\nhard. Most nights he would go home alone, put his old records \\non the player, have a drink, and hum along with them for a \\nfew bars. He had been good, ^mn good. He hadn’t realized \\nhow good he was. Even aside from the special voice, which \\ncould have happened to anybody, he was good. He had been a \\nreal artist and never knew how much he loved it. He’d ruined \\nhis voice with booze and tobacco and broads just when he \\nreally knew what it was all about. \\n\\nSometimes Nino came over for a drink and listened with \\nhim and Johnny would say to him scornfully, ‘You guinea \\nbastard, you never sang like that in your Itfe.’ And Nino \\nwould give him that curiously charming smile and shake his \\nhead and say, ‘No, and I never will,’ in a sympathetic voice, as \\nif he knew what Johnny was thinking. \\n\\nFinally, a week before shooting the new picture, the Aca- \\ndemy Award night rolled around. Johnny invited Nino to \\ncome along but Nino refused. Johnny said, ‘Buddy, 1 never \\n\\n\\n194 \\n\\n\\n\\nasked you a &vour, right? Do me a £aivour tonight and come \\nwith me. You’re the only guy who’ll really feel sorry for me \\nif I don’t win.’ \\n\\nFor one moment Nino looked startled. Then he said, ‘Sure, \\nold buddy, 1 can make it.’ He paused for a moment and said, \\n‘If you don’t win, forget it. Just get as drunk as you can get \\nand I’ll take care of you. Hell, I won’t even drink myself to- \\nnight. How about that for being a buddy?’ \\n\\n‘Man,’ Johnny Fontane said, ‘that’s some buddy.’ \\n\\nThe Academy Award night came and Nino kept his \\npromise. He came to Johnny’s house dead sober and they left \\nfor the presentation theatre together. Nino wondered why \\nJohnny hadn’t invited any of his girls or his ex-wives to the \\nAward dinner. Especially Ginny. Didn’t he think Ginny \\nwould root for him? Nino wished he could have just one \\ndrink, it looked like a long bad night. \\n\\nNino Valenti found the whole A cademy Award affair a bore \\nimtil the winner of the best male actor was announced. When \\nhe heard the words ‘Johnny Fontane’, he found himself \\njumping into the air and applauding. Johnny reached out a \\nhand for him to shake and Nino shook it. He knew his buddy \\nneeded human contact with someone he trusted and Nino felt \\nan enormous sadness that Johnny didn’t have anyone better \\nthan himself to touch in his moment of glory. \\n\\nWhat followed was an absolute nightmare. Jack Woltz’s \\npicture had swept all the major awards and so the studio’s \\nparty was swamped with newspaper people and all the on-the- \\nmake hustlers, male and female. Nino kept his promise to \\nremain sober, and he tried to watch over Johnny. But the \\nwomen of the party kept pulling Johnny Fontanft into bed- \\nrooms for a litde chat and Johnny kept getting drunker and \\ndnmker. \\n\\nMeanwhile the woman who had won the award for the best \\nactress was suffering the same fate but loving it more and \\nhandling it better. Nino turned her down, the only man at the \\nparty to do so. \\n\\nFinally somebody had a great idea. The public mating of the \\ntwo winners, everybody else at the party to be spectators in \\nthe stands. The actress was stripped down and the other \\n\\n\\n195 \\n\\n\\n\\nwomen started to undress Johnny Fontanc. It was then that \\nNino, the only sober person there, grabbed the half-clothed \\nJohnny and slung him over his shoulder and fought his way \\nout of the house and to* their car. As he drove Johnny home, \\nNino thought that if that was success, he didn’t want it. \\n\\n\\n196 \\n\\n\\n\\nBook in \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN \\n\\n\\nThe Don was a real man at the age of twelve. Short, dark, \\nslender, living in the strange Moorish-looking village of \\nCorleonc in Sicily, he had been born Vito Andolini, but when \\nstrange men came to kill the son of the man they had murdered, \\nhis mother sent the young boy to America to stay with friends. \\nAnd in the new land he changed his name to Corlcone to \\npreserve some tie with his native village. It was one of the few \\ngestures of sentimeht he was ever to make. \\n\\nIn Sicily at the turn of the century the Mafia was the second \\ngovernment, far more powerful than the official one in Rome. \\nVito Corleone’s fathcl became involved in a feud with another \\nvillager who took his case to the Mafia. The father refused to \\nknuckle under and in a public quarrel killed the local Mafia \\nchief. A week later he himself was found dead, his body torn \\napart by lupara blasts. A month after the funeral Mafia gunmen \\ncame inquiring after the young boy, Vito. They had decided \\nthat he was too close to manhood, that he might try to avenge \\nthe death of his father in the years to come. The twclve-ycar- \\nold Vito v/as hidden by relatives and shipped to America, \\nThere he was boarded with the Abbandandos, whose son \\nGenco was later to become Consigliori to his Don. \\n\\nYoung Vito went to work in the Abbandando grocery store \\non Ninth Avenue in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen, At the age of \\neighteen Vito married an Italian girl freshly arrived from \\nSicily, a girl of only sixteen but a skilled cook, a good house- \\nwife. They setded down in a tenement on Tenth Avenue, near \\n35 th Street, only a few blocks from where Vito worked, and \\ntwo years later were blessed with their first child, Sanuno, \\ncalled by aU his firiends Sonny because of his devotion to his \\nfather. \\n\\nIn the neighbourhood lived a man called Fanucci. He was a \\n\\n197 \\n\\n\\n\\nheavy-set, fierce-looking Italian who wore expensive light- \\ncoloured suits and a cream-coloured fedora. This man was \\nreputed to be of the ‘Black Hand*, an offshoot of the Mafia \\nwhich extorted money from families and storekeepers by \\nthreat of physical violence. However, since most of the in- \\nhabitants of the neighbourhood were violent themselves, \\nFanucci\\'s threats of bodily harm were effective only with \\nelderly couples without male children to defend them. Some \\nof the storekeepers paid him trifling sums as a matter of con- \\nvenience. However, Fanucd was also a scavenger on fellow \\ncriminals, people who illegally sold Italian lottery or ran \\ngambling games in their homes. The Abbandando grocery \\ngave him a small tribute, this despite the protests of young \\nGenco, who told his father he would settle the Fanucci hash. \\nHis father forbade him. Vito Corleone observed all this with- \\nout feeling in any way involved. \\n\\nOne day Fanucci was set upon by three young men who cut \\nhis throat from ear to ear, not deeply enough to kill him, but \\nenough to frighten him and make him bleed a great deal. Vito \\nsaw Fanucci fleeing from his punishers, the circular slash \\nflowing red. What he never forgot was Fanucci holding the \\ncream-coloured fedora under his chin to catch the dripping \\nblood as he ran. As if he did not want his suit soiled or did not \\nwant to leave a shameful trail of carmine. \\n\\nBut this attack proved a blessing in disguise for Fanucci. \\nThe three young men were not murderers, merely tough \\nyoung boys determined to teach him a lesson and stop him \\nfrom scavenging. Fanucci proved himself a murderer. A few \\nweeks later the knife-wielder was shot to death and the femilies \\nof the other two young men paid an indemnity to Fanucci to \\nmake him forswear his vengeance. After that the tributes \\nbecame higher and Fanucci became a partner in the neighbour- \\nhood gambling games. As for Vito Corleone, it was none of \\nhis afiair. He forgot about it immediately. \\n\\nDuring World War I, when imported olive oil became \\nscarce, Fanucci acquired a part-interest in the Abbandando \\ngrocery store by supplying it not only with oil, but imported \\nItalian salami, hams, and cheeses. He then moved a nephew \\ninto the store and Vito Corleone found himself out of a job. \\n\\n198 \\n\\n\\n\\nBy this time, the second child, Fredetico, had arrived and \\nVito Codeone had four mouths to feed. Up to this time he had \\nbeen a quiet, very contained young man who kept his thoughts \\nto himself. The son of the grocery store owner, young Genco \\nAbbandando, was his closest friend, and to the surprise of \\nboth of them, Vito reproached his friend for his father’s deed. \\nGenco, flushed with shame, vowed to Vito that he would not \\nhave to worry about food. That he, Genco, would steal food \\nfrom the grocery to supply his friend’s needs. This offer \\nthough was sternly refused by Vito as too shameful, a son \\nstealing from his father. \\n\\nThe young Vito, however, felt a cold anger for the dreaded \\nFanucci. He never showed this anger in any way but bided his \\ntime. He worked in the railroad for a few months and then, \\nwhen the war ended, work became slow and he could earn \\nonly a few days’ pay a month. Also, most of the foremen were \\nIrish and American and abused the workmen in the foulest \\nlanguage, which Vito always bore stone-faced as if he did not \\ncomprehend, though he understood English very well despite \\nhis accent. \\n\\nOne evening as Vito was having supper with his family \\nthere was a knock on the window that led to the open air shaft \\nthat separated them from the next building. When Vito pulled \\naside the curtain he saw to his astonishment one of the young \\nmen in the neighbourhood, Peter Clemenza, leaning out from \\na window on the other side of the air shaft. He was extending \\na white shected bundle. \\n\\n*Hey,/>^x<7/i,’ Qemenza said. *Hold these for me until 1 ask \\nfor them. Hurry up.’ Automatically Vito reached over the \\nempty space of the air shaft and took the bundle. Qemenza’s \\nface was strained and urgent. He was in some soft of trouble \\nand Vito’s helping action was instinctive. But when he imtied \\nthe bundle in his kitchen, there were five oily guns staining the \\nwhite cloth. He put them in his bedroom closet and waited* \\nHe learned that Qemen 2 a had been taken away by the police. \\nThey must have been knocking on his door when he handed \\nthe guns over the air shaft.. \\n\\nVito never said a word to anyone and of course his terrifled \\nwife dared not open her lips even in gossip for fear her own \\n\\n\\n199 \\n\\n\\n\\nhusband would be sene to prison. Two days later Peter Qe- \\nmenza reappeared in the neighbourhood and asked Vito \\ncasually, ‘Do you have my goods still?’ \\n\\nVito nodded. He was in the habit of talking little. Clemenza \\ncame up to his tenement Hat and was given a glass of wine \\nwhile Vito dug the bundle out of his bedroom closet. \\n\\nClemenza drank his wine, his heavy good-natured face \\nalertly watching Vito. ‘Did you look inside?’ \\n\\nVito, his face impassive, shook his head. ‘I’m not interested \\nin things that don’t concern me,’ he said. \\n\\nThey drank wine together the rest of the evening. They \\nfound each other congenial. Qemenza was a storyteller; Vito \\nCorleone was a listener to storytellers. They became casual \\nfriends. \\n\\nA few days later Qemenza asked the wife of Vito Corleone \\nif she would like a fine rug for her living room floor. He took \\nVito with him to help carry the rug. \\n\\nQemenza led Vito to an apartment house with two marble \\npillars and a white marble stoop. He used a key to open the \\ndoor and they were inside a plush apartment. Qemenza \\ngrunted, ‘ Go on the other side of the room and help me roll it \\nup.’ \\n\\nThe rug was a rich red wool. Vito Corleone was astonished \\nby Qemenza’s generosity. Together they roUed the rug into a \\npile and Qemenza took one end while Vito took the other. \\nThey lifted it and started carrying it towards the door. \\n\\nAt that moment the apartment bell rang. Qemenza imme- \\ndiately dropped the rug and strode to the window. He pulled \\nthe drape aside slightly and what he saw made him draw a gun \\nfrom inside his jacket. It was only at that moment the aston- \\nished \\'Vito Corleone realized that they were stealing the rug \\nfirom some stranger’s apartment. \\n\\nThe apartment bell rang again. Vito went up alongside \\nQemenza so that he too could see what was happening. At the \\ndoor was a uniformed policeman. As they watched, the police- \\nman gave the doorbell a final push, then shrugged and walked \\naway down the marble steps and down the street. \\n\\nQemenza grunted in a satisfied way and said, ‘Come on, let’s \\ngo.’ He picked up his end of the rug and Vito picked up the \\n\\n\\n200 \\n\\n\\n\\nother end. The policeman had barely turned the corner before \\nthey were edging out the hea\\'vy oaken door and into the street \\nwith the rug between them- Thirty minutes later they were \\ncutting the rug to fit the living room of Vito Corleone^s apart- \\nment. They had enough left over for the bedroom. Qemenaa \\nwas an expert workman and from the poclcets of his wide, ill- \\nfitting jacket (even then he liked to wear loose clothes though \\nhe was not so fat), he had the necessary carpet-cutting tools. \\n\\nTime went on, things did not improve. The Corleone funily \\ncould not eat the beautiful rug. Very well, there was no work, \\nhis wife and childreo must starve. Vito took some parcels of \\nfood from his friend Genco while he thought things out. \\nFinally he was approached by Qemenza and Tessio, another \\nyoung tough of the neighbourhood. They were men who \\nthought well of him, the way he carried himself, and they \\nknew he was desperate. They proposed to him that he become \\none of their gang which specialized in hijacking trucks of silk \\ndresses after those trucks were loaded up at the fiictory on 3 ist \\nStreet. There was no risk. The truck drivers were sensible \\nworking-men who at the sight of a gun Hopped on the side- \\nwalk like angels while the hijackers drove the truck away to be \\nunloaded at a friend’s warehouse. Some of the merchandise \\nwould be sold to an Italian wholesaler, part of the loot would \\nbe sold door-to-door in th^ Italian neighbourhoods - Arthur \\nAvenue in the Bronx, Mulberry Street, and the Chelsea district \\nin Manhattan - all to poor Italian families looking for a \\nbargain, whose daughters could never be able to afford such \\nfine apparel. Clemenza and Tessio needed Vito to drive since \\nthey knew he chauffeured the Abbandando grocery store de- \\nlivery truck. In 1919, skilled automobile drivers were at a \\npremium. \\n\\nAgaiiist his better judgement, Vito Corleone accepted their \\noHer. The dinchmg argument was that he would clear at least a \\nthousand dollars for his share of the job. But his young com- \\npanions struck him as rash, the planning of the job haphazard, \\nthe distribution of the loot foolhardy. Their whole approach \\nwas too careless for his taste. But lie thought them of good, \\nsound character. Peter Qemenza, already burly, inspired a \\ncertain trust, and the lean saturnine Tessio inspir^ confidence. \\n\\n\\naoi \\n\\n\\n\\nThe job itself went off without a hitch. Vito Cotleone felt no \\nfear» much to his astonishment, when his two comrades flashed \\nguns and made the driver get out of the silk truck. He was also \\nimpressed with the coolness of Qemenza and Tessio. They \\ndidn’t get excited but joked with the driver, told him if he was \\na good lad they’d send his wife a few dresses. Because Vito \\nthought it stupid to peddle dresses himself and so gave his \\nwhole share of stock to the fence, he made only seven hundred \\ndollars. But this was a considerable sum of money in 1919. \\n\\nThe next day on the street, Vito Corleone was stopped by \\nthe cream-suited, white-fedoraed Fanned. Fanned was a \\nbrutal-looking man and he had done nothing to disguise the \\ncircular scar that stretched in a white semicircle from ear to \\near, looping under his chin. He had heavy black brows and \\ncoarse features which, when he smiled, were in some odd way \\namiable. \\n\\nHe spoke with a very thick Sicilian accent. *Ah, young \\nfellow,’ he said to Vito. ‘People tell me you’re rich. You and \\nyour two friends. But don’t you think you’ve treated me a little \\nshabbily? After all, this is my neighbourhood and you should \\nlet me wet my beak.’ He used the Sicilian phrase of the Mafia, \\n‘ Fart vagnari a Pi!(zu means the beak of any small bird \\n\\nsuch as a canary. The phrase itself was a demand for part of the \\nloot. \\n\\nAs was his habit, Vito Corleone did not answer. He under- \\nstood the implication immediately and was waiting for a \\ndefinite demand. \\n\\nFanned smiled at him, showing gold teeth and stretching \\nhis noose-like scar tight around his face. He mopped his face \\nwith a handkerchief and unbuttoned his jacket for a moment as \\nif to cool himself but really to show the gun he carried stuck \\nin the waistband of his comfortably wide trousers. Then he \\nsighed and said, ‘ &ive me five hundred dollars and I’ll forget \\nthe insult. After all, young people don’t know the courtesies \\ndue a man like myself.’ \\n\\nVito Corleone smiled at him and even as a young man sdll \\nunblooded, there was something so chilling in his smile that \\nFanued hesitated a moment before going on. ‘Otherwise the \\npolice will come to see you, your and children will be \\n\\n\\n20s \\n\\n\\n\\nfthamed and destitute. Of course if my information as to your \\ngains is incorrect I’ll dip my beak just a little. But no less than \\nthree hundred dollars. And don’t try to deceive me.’ \\n\\nFor the £rst time Vito Corleone spoke. His voice was \\nreasonable^ showed no anger. It was courteous, as befitted a \\nyoung man speaking to an older man of Fanucci’s eminence. \\nHe said softly, *My two friends have my share of the money. \\nI’ll have to speak to them.’ \\n\\nFanucci was reassured. * You can tell your two friends that I \\nexpect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner. Don’t \\nbe afraid to tell them,’ he added reassuringly. Xlememsa and I \\nknow each other well, he understands these things. Let your- \\nself be guided by him. He has more experience in these \\nmatters.’ \\n\\nVito Corleone shrugged. He tried to look a litde embar- \\nrassed. ^Of course,’ he said. ‘You understand this is all new to \\nme. Thank you for speaking to me as a godfather.’ \\n\\nFanucci was impressed. ‘You’re a good fellow,’ he said.. He \\ntook Vito’s hand and clasped it in both of his hairy ones. * You \\nhave respect,’ he said. ‘A fine thing in the young. Next time \\nspeak to me first, eh? Perhaps I can help you in your plans.’ \\n\\nIn later years Vito Corleone understood tbat what had \\nmade him act in such a perfect, tactical way with Fanucci was \\nthe death of his own hot-tempered father who had been \\nkilled by the Mafia in Sicily. But at that time all he felt was an \\nicy rage that this man planned to rob him of the money he had \\nrisked his life and freedom to earn. He had not been afraid. \\nIndeed he thought, at that moment, that Fanucci was a cra2y \\nfool. From what he had seen of Qemenxa, that burly Sicilian \\nwould sooner give up his life than a penny of hi^ loot. After \\nall, Qemenza had been ready to kill a policeman merely to \\nsteal a rug. And the slender Tessio had the deadly air of a \\nviper. \\n\\nBut later that night, in Qemenza’s tenement apartment \\nacross the air shaft, Vito Corleone received another lesson in \\nthe education he had just begun. Clemenza cursed, Tessio \\nscowled, but then both men started talking about whether \\nFanucci would be satisfied with two hundred dollars. Tessio \\nthought he might. \\n\\n\\n203 \\n\\n\\n\\nGemenza was positive. that scarface bastard must have \\nfound out what we made from the wholesaler who bought \\nthe dresses. Fanucci won’t take a dime less than three hundred \\ndollars. We’ll have to pay.’ \\n\\nVito was astonished but was careful not to show his aston- \\nishment. ‘Why do we have to pay him? What can he do to the \\nthree of us? We’re stronger than him. We have guns. Why do \\nwe have to hand over the money we earned?* \\n\\nGemenza explained patiently. ‘Fanucci has friends, real \\nbrutes. He has connexions with the police. He’d like us\\' to tell \\nhim our plans because he could set us up for the cops and earn \\ntheir gratitude. \\'Ihcn they would owe him a favour. That’s \\nhow he operates. And he has a licence from Maranzalla him- \\nself to work this neighbourhood.’ Maranzalla was a gangster \\noften in the newspapers, reputed to be the leader of a criminal \\nring specializing in extortion, gambling, and armed robbery. \\n\\nGemenza served wine that he had made himself. His wife, \\nafter putting a plate of salami, olives, and a loaf of Italian bread \\non the table, went down to sit with her women cronies in \\nfront of the building, carrying her chair with her. She was a \\nyoung Italian girl only a few years in the country and did not \\nyet understand English. \\n\\nVito Corleone sat with his two friends and drank wine. He \\nhad never used his intelligence before as he was using it now. \\nHe was surprised at how clearly he could think. He recalled \\neverything he knew about Fanucci. He remembered the day \\nthe man had had his throat cut and had run down the street \\nholding his fedora under his chin to catch the dripping blood. \\nHe remembered the murder of the man who had wielded the \\nknife and the other two having their sentences removed by \\npaying ati indemnity. And suddenly he was sure that Fanucci \\nhad no great connexions, could not possibly have. Not a man \\nwho informed to the police. Not a man who allowed his ven- \\ngeance to be bought off. A real mafioso chief would have had \\nthe other two men killed also. No, Fanucci had got lucky and \\nkilled one man but had known he could not kill the other two \\nafter they were alerted. And so he had allowed himself to be \\npaid. It was the personal brutal force of the man that allowed \\nhim to levy tribute on the shopkeepers, the gambling games \\n\\n\\n204 \\n\\n\\n\\nthat ran in the tenement apartments. But Vito Corleone knew \\nof at least one gambling game that had never paid Fanucci \\ntributes and nothing had ever happened to the man running it. \\n\\nAnd so it was Fanucci alone. Or Fanucci with some gunmen \\nhired for special jobs on a strictly cash basis. Which left Vito \\nCorleone with another decision. The course his own life must \\ntake* \\n\\nIt was from this experience came his oft-repeated belief that \\nevery tnan has but one destiny. On that night he could have \\npaid Fanucci the tribute and have become again a grocery clerk \\nwith perhaps his own grocery store in the years to come. But \\ndestiny had decided that he was to become a Don and had \\nbrought Fanucci to him to^et him on bis destined path. \\n\\nWlien they finished the bottle of wine, Vito said cautiously \\nto Clemeoza and Tessio, *If you like, why not give me two \\nhundred dollars each to pay to Fanucci? I guarantee he will \\naccept that amount from me. Then leave everything in my \\nhands. I’ll settle this problem zo your satisfaction.* \\n\\nAt once Qemenza’s eyes gleamed with suspicion. Vito said \\nto him coldly, ‘I never lie to people I have accepted as my \\nftiends. Speak to Fanucci yourself tomorrow. Let him ask you \\nfor the money. But don’t pay him. And don’t in any way \\nquarrel with him. Tell him you have to get the money and will \\ngive it to me to give him. Let him understand that you are \\nwilling to pay what he asks. Don’t bargain. I’ll quarrel over \\nthe price with him. There’s no point making him angry with \\nus if he’s as dangerous a man as you say he is.’ \\n\\nThey left it at that. The next day Qemenza spoke with \\nFanucci to make sure that Vito was not making up the story. \\nThen Qemenxa came to Vito’s apartment and gave him the \\ntwo hundred dollars. He peered at Vito Codeohe and said, \\n*Fanuccd told me nothing below three hundred dollars, how \\nwill you make him take less?’ \\n\\nVito Corleone said reasonably, * Surely that’s no concern of \\nyours. Just remember that I’ve done you a service.’ \\n\\nTessio came later. Tessio was more reserved than Qcmenaa, \\nsharper, more clever but with less force. He sensed something \\namiss, something not quite right. He was a little worried. He \\nsaid to Vito Corleone, * Watch yourself with that bastard of a \\n\\n\\n205 \\n\\n\\n\\nBlack Hand, he’s tdcky as a pnest. Do you \\'want me to be here \\nwhen you hand him the money, as a witness?’ \\n\\nVito Corleone shook his head. He didn’t even bother to \\nanswer. He merely said to Tcssio, ‘Tell Fanucci I’ll pay him \\nthe money here in my house at nine o’clock tonight. I’ll have \\nto give him a glass of wine and talk, reason with him to take \\nthe lesser sum.’ \\n\\nTessio shook his head. * You won’t have much luck. Fanucci \\nnever retreats.* \\n\\n*1*11 reason with him,* Vito Corleone said. It was to become \\na famous phrase in the years to come. It was to become the \\nwarning rattle before a deadly strike.iWhen he became a Don \\nand asked opponents to sit down and reason with him, they \\nunderstood it was the last chance to resolve an afiair without \\nbloodshed and murder. \\n\\nVito Corleone told his wife to take the two children. Sonny \\nand Fredo, down into the street after supper and on no \\naccount to let them come up to the house until he gave her \\npermission. She was to sit on guard at the tenement door. He \\nhad some private business with Fanucci that could not be in- \\nterrupted. He saw the look of fear on her face and was angry. \\nHe said to her quiedy, *Do you think you’ve married a fool?’ \\nShe didn’t answer. She did not answer because she was \\nfrightened, not of Fanucci now, but of her husband. He was \\nchanging visibly before her eyes, hour by hour, into a man \\nwho radiated some dangerous force. He had always been quiet, \\nspeaking litde, but always gende, always reasonable, which \\nwas extraordinary in a young Sicilian male. What she was \\nseeing was the shedding of his protective coloradon of a harm- \\nless nobody now that he was ready to start on his destiny. He \\nhad sftarted late, he was twenty-five years old, but he was to \\nstart with a flourish. \\n\\nVito Corleone had decided to murder Fanucci. By doing so \\nhe would have an extra seven hundred dollars in his bankroll. \\nThe three hundred dollars he himself would have to pay the \\nBlack Hand terrorist and the two hundred dollars from Tessio \\nand the two himdred dollars from Qemenza. If he did not kill \\nFanucci, he would have to pay the man seven hundred dollars \\ncold cash. Fanucci alive was not worth seven hundred doUars \\n\\n\\n206 \\n\\n\\n\\nto him. He would not pay seven hundred dollars to keep \\nFanned alive. If Fanned needed seven himdred dollars for an \\noperation to save his life, he would not give Fanned seven \\nhundred dollars for the surgeon. He owed Fanued no personal \\ndebt of gratitude, they were not blood relatives, he did not \\nlove Fanued. Whyfore, then, should he give Fanned seven \\nhundred dollars? \\n\\nAnd it followed inevitably, that since Fanucci wished to take \\nseven hundred dollars from him by force, why should he not \\nkill Fanned? Surely the world could do without such a person. \\n\\nThere were of course some practical reasons. Fanued might \\nindeed have powerful friends who would seek vengeance. \\nFanucci himself was a dangerous man, not so easily killed. \\nThere were the police and the electric chair. But Vito Corleone \\nhad lived under a sentence of death since the murder of his \\nfather. As a boy of twelve he had fled his executioners and \\ncrossed the ocean into a strange land, taking a strange name. \\nAnd years of quiet observation had convinced him that he had \\nmore intelligence and more courage than other men, though \\nhe had never had the opportunity to use that intelligence and \\ncourage. \\n\\nAnd yet he hesitated before taking that first step towards his \\ndestiny. He even packed the seven hundred dollars in a single \\nfold of bills and put the money in a convenient side pocket of \\nhis trousers. But he put the money in the left side of his \\ntrousers. In the right-hand pocket he put the gun Qememsa \\nhad given him to use in the hijacking of the silk truck. \\n\\nFanucci came promptly at nine in the evening. Vito Corleone \\nset out a jug of homemade wine that Clemenaa had given him. \\n\\nFanucci put his white fedora on the table beside the jug of \\nwine. He i^oosened his broad multiflowered tie, its tomato \\nstains camouflaged by the bright patterns. The summer night \\nwas hot, the gaslight feeble. It was very quiet in the apartment. \\nBut Vito Corleone was icy. To show his good faith he handed \\nover the roll of bills and watched carefully as Fanucci, after \\ncoimting it, took out a wide leather wallet and stuffed the \\nmoney inside. Fanucci sipped his glass of wine and said, * You \\nstill owe me two hundred doUai^.’ His heavy-browed face was \\nCKpressiooiess. \\n\\n\\naoy \\n\\n\\n\\nVito Corleone said in his cool reasonable voice, *I*m a litdc \\nshort. I’ve been out of work. Let me owe you the money for a \\nfew weeks.* \\n\\nThis was a permissible gambit. Fanucd had the bulk of the \\nmoney and would wait.. He might even be persuaded to take \\nnothing more or to wait a little longer. He chuckled over iiis \\nwine and said, ‘Ah, you’re a sharp young fellow. How is it I’ve \\nnever noticed you before? You’re too quiet a chap for your \\nown interest. I could find some work for you to do that would \\nbe very profitable.* \\n\\nVito Corleone showed his interest with a polite nod and \\nfilled up the man’s glass from the purple jug. But Fanucci \\nthought better of what he was going to say and rose from liis \\nchair and shook Vito’s hand. ‘Goodnight, young fellow,’ he \\nsaid. ‘No hard feelings, eh? If 1 can ever do you a service let \\nme know. You\\'ve done a good job for yourself tonight.’ \\n\\nVito let Fanucci go down the stairs and out the building. \\nThe street was thronged with witnesses to show that he had \\nleft the Corleone home safely. Vito watched from the window. \\nHe saw Fanucci turn the comer towards Eleventh Avenue and \\nknew he was headed towards his apartment, probably to put away \\nhis loot before coming out on the streets again. Perhaps to put \\naway his gun. Vito Corleone left his apartment and ran up the \\nstairs to the roof. He travelled over the square block of roofs \\nand descended down the steps of an empty loft building fire \\nescape that left him in the back yard. He kicked the back door \\nopen and went through the front door. Across the street was \\nFanucci’s tenement apartment house. \\n\\nThe viUage of tenements extended only as fiu: west as Tenth \\nAvenue. Eleventh Avenue was mostly warehouses ^d lofts \\nrented by firms who shipped by New York Central Railroad \\nand wanted access to the ficight yards that honeycombed the \\narea from Eleventh Avenue to the Hudson River. Fanucci’s \\napartment house was one of the few left standing in this \\nwilderness and was occupied mostly by bachelor trainmen, \\nyard workers, and the cheapest prostitutes. These people did \\nnot sit in the street and gossip like honest Indians, they sat in \\nbeer taverns guzzling their pay. So Vito Corleone found it an \\neasy matter to slip across the deserted Eleventh Avenue and \\n\\n2o8 \\n\\n\\n\\ninto the vestibule of Fanucd’s apartment house. There he \\ndrew the gun he had never fired and waited for Fanned. \\n\\nHe watched through the glass door of the vestibule, know- \\ning Fanucci would come down from Tenth Avenue. Qemenaa \\nhad showed him the safety on the gun and he had triggered it \\nempty- But as a young boy in Sicily at the early age of nine, he \\nhad often gone hunting with his father, had often fired the \\nheavy shotgun called the lupara. It was his skill with the lupara \\neven as a small boy that had brought the s<:ntence of death \\nupon him by his father’s murderers. \\n\\nNow waiting in the darkened hallway, he saw the white blob \\nof Fanucci crossing the street towards the doorway. Vito \\nstepped back, shoulders pressed against the inner door that led \\nto the stairs. He held his gun out to fire. His extended hand \\nwas only two paces from the outside door. The door swung \\nin. Fanucci, white, broad, smelly, jfilled the square of light. \\nVito Corleonc fired. \\n\\nThe opened door let some of the sound escape into the \\nstreet, the rest of the gun’s explosion shook the building. \\nFanucci was holding on to the sides of the door, trying to stand \\nerect, trying to reach for his gun. The force of his struggle had \\ntorn the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose. His gun \\nwas exposed but so was a spidery vein of red on the white \\nshirtfront of his stomach. Very carefully, as if he were plung- \\ning a needle into a vein, Vito Corleone fired his second bullet \\ninto that red web. \\n\\nFanucci fell to his knees, propping the door op^n. He let out \\na terrible groan, the groan of a man in great physical distress \\nthat was almost comical. He kept giving these groans; Vito \\nremembered hearing at least three of them before 4ie put the \\ngun against Fanucci’s sweaty, suety cheek and fired into his \\nbrain. No mote than five seconds had passed when Fanucci \\nslumped into death, jamming the door open with his body. \\n\\nVery carefully Vito took the wide wallet out of the dead \\nman’s jacket pocket and put it inside his shirt. Then he walked \\nacross the street into the loft building, through that into the \\nyard and climbed the fire escape to the roof. From there he \\nsurveyed the street. Fanucci’s body was still lying in the door- \\nway but there was no sign of any other person. Two windows \\n\\n\\n209 \\n\\n\\n\\nhad gone up in the tenement and he could see dark heads \\npoked out but since he could not see their features they had \\ncertainly not seen his. And such men would not give informa- \\ntion to the police. Fanucci might lie there until dawn or until a \\npatrolman making the rounds stumbled on his body. No per- \\nson in that house would deliberately expose himseh to police \\nsuspicion or questioning. They would lock their doors and \\npretend they had heard nothing. \\n\\nHe could take his time. He travelled over the rooftops to his \\nown roof door and down to his own flat. He unlocked the \\ndoor, went inside and then locked the door behind him. He \\nrifled the dead man\\'s wallet. Besides the seven hundred dollars \\nhe had given Fanucci there were only some singles and a five- \\ndoUar note. \\n\\nTucked inside the flap was an old five-dollar gold piece, \\nprobably a luck token. If Fanucci was a rich gangster, he \\ncertainly did not carry his wealth with him. This confirmed \\nsome of Vito’s suspicions. \\n\\nHe knew he had to get rid of the wallet and the gun (know- \\ning enough even then that he must leave the gold piece in the \\nwallet). He went up on the roof again and travelled over a few \\nledges. He threw the wallet down one air shaft and then he \\nemptied the gun of bullets and smashed its barrel against the \\nroof ledge. The barrel wouldn’t break. He reversed it in his \\nhand and smashed the butt against the side of a chimney. The \\nbutt split into two halves. He smashed it again and the pistol \\nbroke into barrel and handle, two separate pieces. He used \\na separate air shaft for each. They made no sound when \\nthey struck the earth five storeys below, but sank into the soft \\nhill of garbage that had accumulated there. In the morn- \\ning more garbage would be thrown out of the windows and, \\nwith luck, would cover everything. Vito returned to his apart- \\nment. \\n\\nHe was trembling a little but wa» absolutely under control. \\nHe changed his clothes and fearful that some blood might have \\nsplattered on them, he threw them into a metal tub his wife \\nused for washing. He took lye and heavy brown laundry soap \\nto soak the clothes and scrubbed them with the metal wash \\nboard beneath the sink. Then he scoured tub and sink with lye \\n\\n\\n210 \\n\\n\\n\\nand soap. He found a bundle of newly-washed clothes in the \\ncomer of the bedroom and mingled his own clothes with these. \\nThen he put on a fresh shirt and trousers and went down to \\njoin his wife and children and neighbours in front of the \\ntenement. \\n\\nAll these precautions proved to be unnecessary. The police, \\nafter discovering the dead body at dawn, never questioned \\nVito Corleone. Indeed he was astonished that they never \\nlearned about Fairucd’s visit to his home on the night he was \\nshot to death. He had counted on that for an alibi, Fanucci \\nleaving the tenement alive. He only learned later that the \\npolice had been delighted with the murder of Fanucci and not \\ntoo anxious to pursue his killers. They had assumed it was \\nanother gang execution, and had questioned hoodlums with \\nrecords in the rackets and a history of strong-arm. Since Vito \\nhad never been in trouble he never came into the picture. \\n\\nBut if he had outwitted the police, his partners were another \\nmatter. Pete Clemenra and Tessio avoided him for the next \\nweek, for the next two weeks, then they came to call on him \\none evening. They came with obvious respect. Vito Corleone \\ngreeted them with impassive courtesy and served them wine. \\n\\nQemenza spoke first. He said softly, ‘Nobody is collecting \\nfrom the store owners on Ninth Avenue, Nobody is collecting \\nfrom the card games and gambling in the neighbourhood.* \\n\\nVito Corleone gaxed at both men steadily but did not reply. \\nTessio spoke. ‘We could take over Fanucci’s customers. TTaey \\nwould pay us.\\' \\n\\nVito Corleone shrugged. ‘Why come to me? I have no \\ninterest in such things.’ \\n\\nQemenxa laughed. Even in his youth, before growing his \\nenormous belly, he had a fat man\\'s laugh. He said now to Vito \\nCorleone, ‘How about that gun I gave you for the truck job? \\nSince you won’t need it any more you can give it back to me.\\' \\n\\nVery slowly and deliberately Vito Corleone took a wad of \\nbills out of his side pocket and peeled off five tens. ‘Here, I\\'ll \\npay you. I threw the gun away after the truck job.\\' He smiled \\nat the two men. \\n\\nAt that time Vito Corleone did not know the effect of this \\nsmile. It was chilling because it attempted no menace. He \\n\\n\\n2II \\n\\n\\n\\nsmiled as if it was some private joke only he himself could \\nappreciate. But since he smiled in that fashion only in affairs \\nthat were lethal, and since the joke was not really private, and \\nsince his eyes did not smile, ami since his outward character \\nwas usually so reasonable and quiet, the sudden unmasking of \\nhis true self was frightening. \\n\\nClemenza shook his head. don’t want the money,’ he said. \\nVito pocketed the bills. He waited. They all understood each \\nother. They knew he had killed Fanucci and though they \\nnever spoke about it to anyone the whole neighbourhood, \\nwithin a few weeks, also knew. Vito Corleone was treated as a \\n*man of respect’ by everyone. But he made no attempt to take \\nover the Fanucci rackets and tributes. \\n\\nWhat followed then was inevitable. One night Vito’s wife \\nbrought a neighbour, a widow, to the flat. The woman was \\nItalian and of unimpeacheable character. She worked hard to \\nkeep a home for her fatherless children. Her sixtecn-y ear-old \\nson brought home his pay envelope sealed, to hand over to her \\nin the old-country style; her scventeen-year-old daughter, a \\ndressmaker, did the same. The whole family sewed buttons on \\ncards at night at slave labour piece rates. The woman’s name \\nwas Signora Colombo. \\n\\nVito Corleonc’s wife said, ‘The Signora has a favour to ask \\nof you. She is having some trouble.’ \\n\\nVito Corleone expected to be asked for money, which he \\nwas ready to give. But it seemed that Mrs Colombo owned a \\ndog which her youngest son adored. The landlord had \\nreceived complaints on the dog barking at night and had told \\nMrs Colombo to get rid of it. She had pretended to do so. The \\nlandlord had found out that she had deceived him and had \\nordered her to vacate her apartment. She had promised this \\ntime to truly get rid of the dog and she had done so. But the \\nlandlord was so angry that he would not revoke his order. She \\nhad to get out or the police would be summoned to put her \\nout. And her poor little boy bad cried so when they had given \\nthe dog away to relatives who lived in Long Island. All for \\nnothing, they would lose their home. \\n\\nVito Q>rleone asked her gendy, \\'Why do you ask me to help \\nyou?’ \\n\\n\\n211 \\n\\n\\n\\nMrs Colombo nodded towards his wife. * She told me to ask \\nyou/ \\n\\nHe was siurprised. His wife had never questioned him about \\nthe clothes he had washed the night he had murdered Fanucci. \\nHad never asked him where all the money came from when he \\nwas not working. Even now her face was impassive. Vito said \\nto Mrs Colombo, ‘I can give you some money to help you \\nmove, is that what you want?* \\n\\nThe woman shook her head, she was in tears. ‘All my friends \\nare here, all the girls I grew up with in Italy. How can I move \\nto another neighbourhood with strangers? 1 want you to \\nspeak to the landlord to let me stay.* \\n\\nVito nodded. ‘It’s done then. You won’t have to move. I’ll \\nspeak to him tomorrow morning.* \\n\\nHis wife gave him a smile which he did not acknowledge, \\nbut he felt pleased. Mrs Colombo looked a little uncertain. \\n‘You’re sure he’ll say yes, the iat dlord?* she asked. \\n\\n* Signor Roberto?’ Vito said in a surprised voice. ‘Of course \\nhe will. He’s a good-hearted fellow. Once I explain how things \\nare with you he’ll take pity on your misfortunes. Now don’t let \\nit trouble you any more. Don’t get so upset. Guard your \\nhealth, for the sake of your children.’ \\n\\nThe landlord, Mr Roberto, came to the neighbourhood \\nevery day to check on the row of five tenements that he owned. \\nHe was a padrone^ a man who sold Italian labourers just off the \\nboat to the big corporations. With his profits he had bought \\nthe tenements one by one. An educated man from the North of \\nItaly, he felt only contempt for these illiterate Southerners \\nfrom Sicily and Naples who swarmed like vermin through his \\nbuildings, who threw garbage down the air shafts, who let \\ncockroaches and rats eat away his walls without lifting a hand \\nto preserve his property. He was not a bad man, he was a good \\nhusband and father, but constant worry about his investments, \\nabout the money he earned, about the inevitable expenses that \\ncame with being a man of property had worn his nerves to a \\nfrazzle so that he was in a constant state of irritation. When \\nVito Corleone stopped him on the street to ask for a word, Mr \\nRoberto was brusque. Not rude, since any one of these \\n\\n\\n213 \\n\\n\\n\\nSoutherners might stick a knife into you if rubbed the wrong \\nway, though this young man looked like a quiet fellow. \\n\\n‘ Signor Roberto,\\' said Vito Corleone, ‘the friend of my wife, \\na poor widow with no man to protect her, tells me that for \\nsome reason she has been ordered to move from her apart- \\nment in your building. She is in despair. She has no money, she \\nhas no friends except those that live here. I told her that I \\nwould speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted \\nout of some misunderstanding. She has got rid of the animal \\nthat caused all the trouble and so why shouldn’t she stay? As \\none Italian to another, I ask you the favour.’ \\n\\nSignor Roberto studied the young man in front of him. He \\nsaw a man of medium stature but strongly built, a peasant but \\nnot a bandit, though he so laughably dared to call himself an \\nItalian. Roberto shrugged. ‘1 have already rented the apart- \\nment to another family for higher rent,’ he said. ‘I cannot dis- \\nappoint them for the sake of your friend.’ \\n\\nVito Corleone nodded in agreeable understanding. ‘How \\nmuch more a month?’ he asked. \\n\\n‘Five dollars,’ Mr Roberto said. This was a lie. The railway \\nflat, four dark rooms, rented for twelve dollars a month to the \\nwidow and he had not been able to get more than that from the \\nnew tenant. \\n\\nVito Cqrleone took a roll of bills out of his pocket and \\npeeled ofi* three tens. ‘Here is the six months’ increase in ad- \\nvance. You needn’t speak to her about it, she’s a proud \\nwoman. See me again in another six months. But of course \\nyou’ll let her keep her dog.’ \\n\\n‘Like hell,’ Mr Roberto said. ‘And who the hell are you to \\ngive me orders. Watch your manners or you’ll be out on your \\nSicilian ass in the street there.’ \\n\\nVito Corleone raised his hands in surprise. *l’m asking you \\na favour, only that. One never knows when one might ne^ a \\nfriend, isn’t that true? Here, take this money as a sign of my \\ngoodwill and make your own decision. I wouldn’t dare to \\nquarrel with it.’ He thrust the money into Mr Roberto’s hand. \\n‘ Do me this little favour, just take the money and think things \\nover. Tomorrow morning if you want to give me the money \\nback by all means do so. If you want the woman out of your \\n\\n\\n214 \\n\\n\\n\\nhouse, how can I stop you? It*s your property, after fill. If you \\ndon’t want the dog in there, 1 can understand. I dislike \\nanimals myself.’ He patted Mr Roberto on the shoulder. ‘Do \\nme this service, eh? I won’t forget it. Ask your friends in the \\nneighbourhood about me, they’ll tell you Fm a man who \\nbelieves in showing his gratitude.’ \\n\\nBut of course Mr Roberto had already begun to understand. \\nThat evening he made inquiries about Vito Corleone. He did \\nnot wait until the next morning. He knocked on the Corleone \\ndoor that very night, apologmng for the lateness of the hour \\nand accepted a glass of wine from Signora Corleone. He \\nassured Vito Corleone that it had all been a dreadful misunder- \\nstanding, that of course Signora Colombo could remain in the \\nflat, of course she could keep her dog. Who were those \\nmiserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor \\nanimal when they paid such a low rent? At the finish he t^ew \\nthe thirty dollars Vito Corleone had given him on the table \\nand said in the most sincere fashion, ‘Your good heart in \\nhelping this poor widow has shamed me and I wish to show \\nthat I, too, have some Christian charity* Her rent will remain \\nwhat it was.’ \\n\\nAH concerned played this comedy prettily. Vito poured \\nwine, called for cakes, wrung Mr Roberto’s hand and praised \\nhis warm heart. Mr Roberto sighed and said that having made \\nthe acquaintance of such a man as Vito Corleone restored his \\nfidth in human nature. Finally they tore themselves away from \\neach other. Mr Roberto, his bones turned to jelly with fear at \\nhis narrow escape, caught the streetcar to his home in the \\nBronx and took to his bed. He did not reappear in his tene- \\nments for three days. \\n\\n* \\n\\nVito Corleone was now a ‘man of respect ’ in the neighbour- \\nhood. He was reputed to be a member of the Mafia of Sicily. \\nOne day a man who ran card games in a furnished room came \\nto bitn s^id voluntarily paid him twenty dollars each week for \\nhis ‘friendship’. He h^ only to visit the game once or twice a \\nweek to let the players understand they were under his protec- \\ntion. \\n\\nStore owners who had problems with young hoodlums \\n\\n\\n\\nasked him to intercede. He did so and was properlyre warded. \\nSoon be had the enormous income for that time and place of \\none hundred dollars a week. Since Qemenaa and Tessio were \\nhis friends, his allies, he had to give them each part of the \\nmoney, but this he did without being asked. Finally he decided \\nto go into the olive oil importing business with his boyhood \\nchum, Genco Abbandando. Genco would handle the business^ \\nthe importing of the olive oil from Italy, the buying at the \\nproper price, the storing in his father’s warehouse. Genco had \\nthe experience for this part of the business. Qemenza and \\nTessio would be the salesmen. They would go to every Italian \\ngrocery store in Manhattan, then Brooklyn, then the Bronx, to \\npersuade store owners to stock Genco Pura olive oil. (With \\ntypical modesty, Vito Corleone refused to name the brand \\nafter himself.) Vito of coxirse would be the head of the firm \\nsince he was supplying most of the capital. He also would be \\ncalled in on special cases, where store owners resisted the sales \\ntalks of Clemenxa and Tessio. Then Vito Corleone would use \\nhis own formidable powers of persuasion. \\n\\nFor the next few years Vito Corleone lived that completely \\nsatisfying life of a smill businessman wholly devoted to build- \\ning up his commercial enterprise in a d 3 rnamic, expanding \\neconomy. He was a devoted &ther and husband but so busy \\nbe could spare his family little of his time. As Genco Pnra olive \\noil grew to become the best-selling imported Italian oil in \\nAmerica, his organization mushroomed. Like any good \\nbusinessman he came to understand the benefits of under- \\ncutting his rivals in price, barring them from distribution out- \\nlets by persuading store owners to stock less of their brands. \\nLike any good businessman he aimed at holding a monopoly \\nby forcing his rivals to abandon the field or by merging with \\nhis own company. However, since he had started off relatively \\nhelpless, economically, since he did not believe in advertising, \\nrelying on word of mouth, and since if truth be told, his olive \\noil was no better than his competitors’, he could not use the \\ncommon strangleholds of legitimate businessmen. He had to \\nrely on the force of his own personality and his reputation as a \\n‘man of respect’. \\n\\nEven as a young mao, Vito Corleone became known as a \\nai6 \\n\\n\\n\\n‘man of reasonableness’* He never uttered a threat. He always \\nused logic that proved to be irresistible. He always made \\ncertain that the other fellow got his share of profit. Nobody \\nlost. He did this, of course, by obvious means. Like many \\nbusinessmen of genius he learned that free competition was \\nwasteful, monopoly efficient. And so he simply set about \\nachieving that efficient monopoly. There were some oil \\nwholesalers in Brooklyn, men of fiery temper, headstrong, not \\namenable to reason, who refused to see, to recogai2e, the \\nvision of Vito Qirleone, even after he had explained every- \\nthing to them with the utmost patience and det^. With these \\nmen Vito Corlcone threw up his hands in despair and sent \\nTessio to Brooklyn to set up a headquarters and solve the \\nproblem. Warehouses were burned, truckloads of olive-green \\noil were dumped to form lakes in the cobbled waterfront \\nstreets. One rash man, an arrogant Milanese with more fiuth \\nin the police than a saint has in Christ, actually went to the \\nauthorities with a complaint against his fellow Italians, break- \\ning the ten-century-old law of omtrta. But before the matter \\ncould progress any further the wholesaler disappeared, never \\nto be seen again, leaving behind, deserted, bis devot^ wife \\nand three children, who, God be thanked, were fully grown \\nand capable of taking over his business and coming to terms \\nwith the Gmeo Pura Oil Company. \\n\\nBut great men are not bom great, they grow great, and so k \\nwas with Vito Corleone. When Prohibition came to pass and \\nalcohol forbidden to be sold, Vito Corleone made the final \\nstep from a quite ordinary, somewhat mthless businessman to \\na great Don in the world of criminal enterprise. It did not \\nhappen in a day, it did not happen in a year, but byjche end of \\nthe Prohibition period and the start of the Great Depression, \\nVito Corlcone had become the Godfather, the Don, Don \\nCorleone. \\n\\nIt started casuaUy enough. By this time the Gefuo Ptira Oil \\nCompany had a fleet of six delivery trucks. Through Qemenza, \\nVito Corleone was approached by a group of Italian boot- \\nleggers who smuggl^ alcohol and whisky in from QinaHa \\nThey needed trucks and deliverymen to distribute \\nproduce over New York City. They needed deliverymen who \\n\\n«7 \\n\\n\\n\\nwere reliable, discreet, and of a certain determination and force. \\nThey were willing to pay Vito Corleone for his trucks and for \\nhis men. The fee was so enormous that Vito Corleone cut back \\ndrastically on his oil business to use the trucks almost ex- \\nclusively for the service of the bootlegger-smugglers. This \\ndespite the fact that these gentlemen had accompanied their \\noffer with a silky threat. But even then Vito Corleone was so \\nmature a man that he did not take insult at a threat or become \\nangry and refuse a profitable offer because of it. He evaluated \\nthe ^reat, found it lacking in conviction, and lowered his \\nopinion of his new partners because they had been so stupid to \\nuse threats where none were needed. This was useful informa- \\ntion to be pondered at its proper time. \\n\\nAgain he prospered. But, more important, he acquired \\nknowledge and contacts and experience. And he piled up good \\ndeeds as a banker piles up securities. For in the following years \\nit became clear that Vito Corleone was not only a man of \\ntalent but, in his way, a genius. \\n\\nHe made himself the protector of the Italian families who \\nset themselves up as smdl speakeasies in their homes, selling \\nwhisky at fifteen cents a glass to bachelor labourers. He \\nbecame godfather to Mrs Colombo’s youngest son when the \\nlad made his confirmation and gave a handsome present of a \\ntwenty-dollar gold piece. Meanwhile, since it was inevitable \\nthat some of his trucks be stopped by the police, Genco \\nAbbandando hired a fine lawyer with many contacts in the \\nPolice Department and the judiciary. A system of payoffs was \\nset up and soon the Corleone organization had a sizeable \\n‘sheet’, the list of officials entitled to a monthly sum. When \\nthe lawyer tried to keep this list down, apologizing for the \\nexpense, Vito Corleone reassured him. ‘No, no,’ he said. ‘Get \\neveryone on it even if they can’t help us right now. 1 believe in \\nfriendship and I am willing to show my friendship first.’ \\n\\nAs time went by the Corleone empire became larger, more \\ntrucks were added, the ‘sheet’ grew longer. Also the men \\nworking directly for Tessio and Clemenza grew in number. \\nThe whole thing was becoming unwieldy. Finally Vito \\nCorleone worked out a system of organization. Pfie gave \\nClemenza and Tessio each the title of Caporeffme^ or captain, \\n\\nzi8 \\n\\n\\n\\nand the men who worked beneath them the rank of soldier. He \\nnamed Genco Abbandando his counsellor, or Consiglicri. He \\nput layers of insulation between himself and any operational \\nact. When he gave an order it was to Genco or to one of the \\ncaporeffmes alone. Rarely did he have a witness to any order he \\ngave any particular one of them. Then he split Tessio’s group \\nand made it responsible for Brooklyn. He also split Tessio ofiF \\nfrom Qemenza and made it clear over the years that he did not \\nwant the two men to associate even socially except when \\nabsolutely necessary. He explained this to the more intelligent \\nTessio, who caught his d^ immediately, though Vito ex- \\nplained it as a security measure against the law. Tessio under- \\nstood that Vito did not want his two caporegimes to have any \\nopportunity to conspire against him and he also understood \\nthere was no ill will involved, merely a tactical precaution. In \\nreturn Vito gave Tessio a free hand in Brooklyn while he kept \\nCIcmenza’s Bronx fief very much under his thumb. Clemenza \\nwas the braver, more reckless, the crueller man despite his out- \\nward jollity, and needed a tighter rein. \\n\\nThe Great Depression increased the power of Vito Corleone. \\nAnd indeed it was about that time he came to be called Don \\nCorleone. Everywhere in the city, honest men begged for \\nhonest work in vain. Proud men demeaned themselves and \\ntheir families to accept official charity from a contemptuous \\nofficialdom. But the men of Don Corleone walked the streets \\nwith their heads held high, their pockets stuffed with silver \\nand paper money. With no fear of losing their jobs. And even \\nDon Corleone, Aat most modest of men, could not help feel- \\ning a sense of pride. He was taking care of his world, his \\npeople. He had not failed those who depended oil him and \\ngave him the sweat of their brows, risked their freedom and \\ntheir lives in his service. And when an employee of his was \\narrested and sent to prison by some mischance, that unfor- \\ntunate man’s family received a living allowance; and not a \\nmiserly, beggarly, begrudging pittance but the same amount \\nthe man earned when free. \\n\\nThis of course was not pure Christian charity. Not his best \\nfriends would have called Don Corleone a saint from heaven. \\nThere was some self-interest in this generosity. An employee \\n\\n\\n219 \\n\\n\\n\\nsent to prison knew he had oniy to keep his mouth shut and \\nhis wife and children would be cared for. He knew that if he \\ndid not inform to the police a warm welcome would be his \\nwhen he left prison. There would be a party waiting in his \\nhome, the best of food, homemade ravioli, wine, pastries, \\nwith all bis friends and relatives gathered to rejoice in his \\nfreedom. And sometime during the night the Consiglioriy \\nGenco Abbandando, or perhaps even the Don himself, would \\ndrop by to pay his respects to such a stalwart, take a glass of \\nwine in his honour, and leave a handsome present of money \\nso that he could enjoy a week or two of leisure with his family \\nbefore returning to his daily toil. Such was the infinite sym- \\npathy and understanding of Don Corleone. \\n\\nIt was at this time that the Don got the idea that he ran his world \\nfar better than his enemies ran the greater world which con- \\ntinually obstructed his path. And this feeling was nurtured by \\nthe poor people of the neighbourhood who constantly came to \\nhim for help. To get on the home relief, to get a young boy a \\njob or out of jail, to borrow a small sum of money desperately \\nneeded, to intervene with landlords who against all reason \\ndemanded rent from jobless tenants. \\n\\nDon Vito Corleone helped them all. Not only that, he \\nhelped them with goodwill, with encouraging words to take \\nthe bitter sting out of the charity he gave them. It was only \\nnatural then that when these Italians were puzzled and con- \\nfused on who to vote for to represent them in the state legis- \\nlature, in the city offices, in the Congress, they should ask the \\nadvice of their friend Don Corleone, their Godfather. And so \\nhe became a political power to be consulted by practical party \\nchiefs. He consolidated this power with a far-seeing states- \\nmanlike intelligence; by helping brilliant boys from poor \\nItalian families through college, boys who would later \\nbecome lawyers, assistant district attorneys, and even judges. \\nHe planned for the future of his empire with all the foresight \\nof a great national leader. \\n\\nThe repeal of Prohibition dealt this empire a crippling blow \\nbut again he had taken his precautions. In 1953 he sent emis- \\nsaries to the man who controlled all the gambling activities of \\nManhattan, the crap games on the docks, the shylocking that \\n\\n\\n220 \\n\\n\\n\\nwent with it as hot dogs go with baseball games, the book- \\nmaking on sports and horses, the illicit gambling houses that \\nran poker games, the policy or numbers racket of Harlem. \\nThis man’s name was Salvatore Maran2ano and he was one of \\nthe acknowledged pe^^novanti^ .90 calibres, or big shots of \\nthe New York underworld. The Corleone emissaries proposed \\nto Maranzano an equal partnership beneficial to both partly. \\nVito Corleone with his organization, his police and political \\ncontacts, could give the Maranzano operations a stout um- \\nbrella and the new strength to expand into Brooklyn and the \\nBronx. But Maranzano was a short-sighted man and spurned \\nthe Corleone offer with contempt. The great A 1 Capone was \\nMaranzano’s friend and he had his own organization, his own \\nmen, plus a huge war chest. He would not brook this upstart \\nwhose reputation was more that of a Parliamentary debator \\nthan a true mafioso. Maranzano’s refusal touched off the \\ngreat war of 1933 which was to change the whole structure of \\nthe underworld in New York City. \\n\\nAt first glance it seemed an uneven match. Salvatore \\nMaranzano had a powerful organization with strong en- \\nforcers. He had a friendship with Capone in Chicago and could \\ncall on help in that quarter. He also had a good relationship \\nwith the Tattaglia Family, which controlled prostitution in the \\ncity and what there was of the thin drug traffic at that time. He \\nalso had political contacts with powerful business leaders who \\nused his enforcers to terrorize the Jewish unionists in the \\ngarment centre and the Italian anarchist syndicates in the \\nbuilding trades. \\n\\nAgainst this Don Corleone could throw two small but \\nsuperbly organized regimes led by Qemenza and Tessio. His \\npolitical and police contacts were negated by the business \\nleaders who would support Maranzano. But in his favour was \\nthe enemy’s lack of intelligence about his organization. The \\nunderworld did not know the true strength of his soldiers and \\neven were deceived that Tessio in Brooklyn was a separate and \\nmdependefit operation. \\n\\nAnd yet despite all this, it was an unequal battle until Vito \\nCodeone evened out the odds with one master stroke. \\n\\nMaranzano sent a call to Capone for his two best gunmen to \\n\\n\\n221 \\n\\n\\n\\ncome to New York to eliminate the upstart. The Corleotie \\nFamily had friends and intelligence in Chicago who relayed the \\nnews that the two gunmen were arriving by train, Vito Cor- \\nleone dispatched Luca Brasi to take care of them with instruc- \\ntions that would liberate the strange man’s most savage \\ninstincts. \\n\\nBrasi and his people, four of them, received the Chicago \\nhoods at the railroad station. One of Brasi’s men procured and \\ndrove a taxicab for the purpose and the station porter carrying \\nthe bags led the Capone men to this cab. When tliey got in, \\nBrasi and another of his men crowded in after them, guns \\nready, and made the two Chicago boys lie on the floor. The \\ncab drove to a warehouse near the docks that B^si had \\nprepared for them. \\n\\nThe two Capone men were bound hand and foot and small \\nbath towels were stuflFed into their mouths to keep them from \\ncrying out. \\n\\nThen Brasi took an axe from its place against the wall and \\nstarted hacking at one of the Capone men. He chopped the \\nman’s feet off, then the legs at the knees, then the thighs where \\nthey joined the torso. Brasi was an extremely powerful man \\nbut it took him many swings to accomplish his purpose. By \\nthat time of course the victim had given up the ghost and the \\nfloor of the warehouse was slippery with the hacked fragments \\nof his flesh and the gouting of his blood. WTien Brasi turned to \\nhis second victim he found further effort unnecessary. The \\nsecond Capone gunman out of sheer terror had, impossibly, \\nswallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated. The \\nbath towel was found in the man’s stomach when the police \\nperformed their autopsy to determine the cause of death. \\n\\nX few days later in Qiicago the Capones received a message \\nfrom Vito Corleone. It was to this effect ; ‘ You know now how \\nI deal with enemies. Why does a Neapolitan interfere in a \\nquarrel between two Sicilians? If you wish me to consider you \\nas a friend I owe you a service which I will pay on demand. A \\nman like yourself must know how much more profitable it is \\nto have a friend who, instead of calling on you £ot help, takes \\ncare of his own affairs and stands ever ready to help you in \\nsome future time of trouble. If you do not wish my fidendship, \\n\\n\\n22Z \\n\\n\\n\\nso be k. But then 1 must tell you that the climate in this city is \\ndamp; unhealthy for Neapolitans, and you are advised never \\nto visit it/ \\n\\nThe arrogance of this letter was a calculated one. The Don \\nheld the Capones in small esteem as stupid, obvious cut- \\nthroats. His intelligence informed him that Capone had for- \\nfeited all political influence because of his public arrogance and \\nthe flaunting of his criminal wealth. The Don knew, in fact \\nwas positive, that without political influence, without the \\ncamouflage of society, Capone’s world, and others like it, \\ncould be easily destroyed. He knew Capone was on the path to \\ndestruction. He also knew that Capone’s influence did not \\nextend beyond the boundaries of Qiicago, terrible and all- \\npervading as that influence there might be. \\n\\nThe tactic was successful. Not so much because of its \\nferocity but because of the chilling swifhiess, the quickness of \\nthe Don’s reaction. If his intelligence was so good, any further \\nmoves would be fraught with danger. It was better, ^ wiser, \\nto accept the offer of friendship with its implied payofll The \\nCapones sent back word that they would not interfere. \\n\\nThe odds were now equal. And Vito Corleone had earned \\nan enormous amount of ‘respect’ throughout the United \\nStates underworld with his humiliation of the Capones. For \\nsix months he outgeneralled Maranzano. He raid^ the crap \\ngames under that man’s protection, located his biggest policy \\nbanker in Harlem and had him relieved of a day’s play not \\nonly in money but in records. He engaged his enemies on aU \\nfronts. Even in the garment centres he sent Qemenza and his \\nmen to flght on the side of the unionists against thp enforcers \\non the payroll of Maranzano and the owners of the dress \\nfirms. And on ail fronts his superior intelligence and organiz- \\nation made him the victor. Clemenza’s jolly ferocity, which \\nCorleone employed judiciously, also helped turn the tide of \\nbattle. And then Don Corleone sent the held-back reserve of \\nthe Tessio regime after Maranzano himself. \\n\\nBy this time Maranzano had dispatched emissaries suing for \\na peace. Vito Corleone refused to sec them, put them off on \\none pretext or another. The Maranzano soldiers were deserting \\ntheir leader, not wishing to die in a losing cause. Bookmakers \\n\\n\\n\\n»nd sbyiocks were paying the Corlcooe organization their \\nprotection money. The war was all but over. \\n\\nAnd then finally on New Year\\'s Eve of 1935, Tessio got \\ninside the defences of Maranzano himself. The Maranzano \\nlieutenants were anxious for a deal and agreed to lead their \\nchief to the slaughter. They told him that a meeting had been \\narranged in a Brooklyn restaurant with Corleone and they \\naccompanied Maranzano as his bodyguards. They left him \\nsitting at a checkered table, morosely munching a piece of \\nbread, and Bed the restaurant as Tessio and four of his men \\nentered. The execution was swift and sure. Maranzano, his \\nmouth fiiU of half-chewed bread, was riddled with bullets. \\nThe war was over. \\n\\nThe Maranzano empire was incorporated into the Corleone \\noperation. Don Corleone set up a system of tribute, allowing \\nall incumbents to remain in their bookmaking and policy \\nnumber spots. As a bonus he had a foothold in the unions of \\nthe garment centre which in later years was to prove ex- \\ntremely important. And now that he had settled his business \\naflEairs the Don found trouble at home. \\n\\nSantino Corleone, Sonny, was sixteen years old and grown \\nto an astonishing six feet with broad shoulders and a heavy \\nface that was sensual but by no means effeminate. But where \\nFredo was a quiet boy, and Michael, of course, a toddler, \\nSantino was constantly in trouble. He got into fights, did \\nbadly in school and, finally, Clemenza, who was the boy\\'s god- \\nfather and had a duty to speak, came to Don Corleone one \\nevening and informed him that his son had taken part in an \\narmed robbery, a stupid affair which could have gone very \\nbadly. Sonny was obviously the ringleader, the two other boys \\nin the robbery his followers. \\n\\nIt was one of the very few times that Vito Corleone lost his \\ntemper. Tom Hagen had been living in his home for three \\nyears and he asked Qemenza if the orphan boy had been in- \\nvolved. Gemenza shook his head. Don Corleone had a car \\nsent to bring Santino to his offices^ the Gtneo Pura Olive Oil \\nCompany. \\n\\nFor the first time, the Don met defeat. Alone with his son, \\nhe gave fiiU vent to his rage, cursing the hulking Sonny in \\n\\n\\n224 \\n\\n\\n\\nSidHan dialect, a language so much more satisfying dian any \\nother for expressing rage. He ended up with a question. * What \\ngave you the right to commit such an act? WiaaLt made you \\nwish to commit such an act?* \\n\\nSonny stood there, angry, refusing to answer. The Don said \\nwith contempt, ‘And so stupid. \\'^9^t did you cam for that \\nnight’s work. Fifty dollars each? Twenty dollars ^ You risked \\nyour life for twenty dollars, eh?’ \\n\\nAs if he had not heard these last words. Sonny said de- \\nfiandy, ‘I saw you kill Fanucci.’ \\n\\nThe Don said, ‘Ahhh’ and sank back in his chair. He waited. \\n\\nSonny said, ‘When Fanucci left the building. Mama said I \\ncould go up the house. I saw you go up the roof and I foUowed \\nyou, I saw everything you did. I stay^ up there and I saw you \\nthrow away the wallet and the gun.’ \\n\\nThf; Don sighed. * Well, then I can’t talk to you about how \\nyou sUGuid behave. Don’t you want to finish school, don’t you \\nio be a lawyer? Lawyers can steal more money wifo a \\nb-a-urc a thousand men with guns and masks.’ \\n\\nx - ^^cd at him and said slyly, ‘I want to enter the \\n‘ r u When he saw that the Don’s fiicc remained \\n\\nhe did not laugh at the joke, he added hastily, \\n‘ I can icam he w to sell olive oil.* \\n\\nStill the Don did not answer. Finally he shrugged. ‘Every \\nman has one destiny,’ he said. He did not add that the witnes- \\nsing of Fanued’s murder had decided that of his son. He \\nmerely turned away and added quietly, ‘Come in tomorrow \\nmorning at nine o’clock. Genco will show you what to do.’ \\n\\nBut Genco Abbandando, with that shrewd insight that a \\nConsigUori must have, realized the true wish of the Don and \\nused Sonny mostly as a bodyguard for his father, a position in \\nwhich he could also learn the subtleties of being a Don. And \\nit brought out a professorial instinct in the Don himself, who \\noften gave lectures on how to succeed for the benefit of his \\neldest son. \\n\\nBesides his oft-repeated theory that a man has hut one \\ndestiny, the Don constantly reproved Sonny for that young \\nman’s outbursts of temper. The Don considered a use of \\nthreats the most foolish kind of exposure; the of \\n\\n«5 \\n\\n\\nGodMcr- Q \\n\\n\\n\\nmgu without foiethooght as the most dangerous iodulgenoe. \\nNo one had ever heard the Don utter a naked threat, no one \\nhad ever seen him in an uncontrollable rage. It was unthink- \\nable. And so he tried to teach Sonny his own disciplines. He \\nclaimed that there was no greater natural advantage in life than \\nhaving an enemy overestimate your faults, unless it was to \\nhave a friend underestimate your virtues. \\n\\nThe caporegimiy Qemenaa, took Sonny in hand and taught \\nhim how to shoot and to wield a garrotte. Sonny had no taste \\nfor the Italian rope, he was too Americanized. He preferred \\nthe simple, direct, impersonal Anglo-Saxon gun, which \\nsaddened Qemenza. But Sonny became a constant and wel- \\ncome companion to his father, driving his car, helping him in \\nlitde details. For the next two years he seemed like the usual \\nson entering his father’s business, not too bright, not too \\neager, content to hold down a soft job. \\n\\nMeanwhile his boyhood chum and semi-adopted brother \\nTom Hagen was going to college. Fredo was still in high \\nschool; Michael, the youngest brother, was in grammar \\nschool, and baby sister Connie was a toddling girl of four. \\nThe funHy had long since moved to an apartment house in the \\nBronx. Don Corleone was considering buying a house in \\nLong Island, but he wanted to fit this in with other plans he \\nwas formulating. \\n\\nVito Corleone was a man with vision. All the great cities of \\nAmerica were being torn by underworld strife. Guerrilla wars \\nby the dozen flared up, ambitious hoodlums trying to carve \\nthemselves a bit of empire; men like Corleone himself were \\ntrying to keep their borders and rackets secure. Don Corleone \\nsaw that the newspapers and government agencies were using \\nthese killings to get stricter and stricter laws, to use harsher \\npolice methods. He foresaw that public indignation might \\neven lead to a suspension of democratic procedures which \\ncould be fatal to him and his people. His own empire, inter- \\nnally, was secure. He decided to bring peace to all the warring \\nfactions in New York Qty and then in the nation. \\n\\nHe had no illusions about the dangerousness of his mission. \\nHe spent the first year meeting with different chiefs of gangs in \\nNew York, laying the groundwork, sounding them out, pro- \\n\\n226 \\n\\n\\n\\npodog spheres of influence that would be honoured by a \\nloosely bound confederated council. But there were too many \\nfactions, too many special interests that conflicted. Agree- \\nment was impossible. Like other great rulers and lawgivers in \\nhistory Don Corleone decided that order and peace were im- \\npossible until the number of reigning states had been reduced \\nto a manageable number.. \\n\\nThere were flve or six ^Families ’ too powerful to eliminate. \\nBut the rest, the neighbourhood Black Hand terrorists, the free- \\nlance shylocks, the strong-arm bookmakers operating without \\nthe proper, that is to say paid, protection of the legal authorities, \\nwould have to go. And so he mounted what was in effect a \\ncolonial war against these people and threw all the resources of \\nthe Corleone organization against them. \\n\\nThe pacifleation of the New York area took three years and \\nhad some unexpected rewards. At first it took the form of bad \\nluck. A group of mad-dog Irish stick-up artists the Don had \\nmarked for exterminadoo almost carried the day with sheer \\nEmerald Isle dan. By chance, and with suicidal bravery, one of \\nthese Idsh gunmen pierced the Don’s proteedve cordon and \\nput a shot into his chest. The assassin was immediately riddled \\nwith bullets but the damage was done. \\n\\nHowever this gave Sandno Corleone his chance. With his \\nfrther out of acdon. Sonny took command of a troop, his own \\nfigiws, with the rank of caportffme, and like a young, un- \\ntrumpeted Napoleon, showed a genius for dty warfiure. He \\nalso showed a merciless ruthlessness, the lack of which had \\nbeen Don Corleone’s only fiiult as a conqueror. \\n\\nFrom 1955 to 1937 Sonny Corleone made a reputation as the \\nmost cunning and relendess execudoner the underworld had \\nyet known. Yet for sheer terror even he was eclipsed by the \\nawesome man named Luca Brasi. \\n\\nIt was Brasi who went after the rest of the Irish gunmen and \\nsingle-handedly wiped them out. It was Brasi, operating alone \\nwhen one of the six powerful fiunilies tded to interfere and \\nbecome the protector of the mdq>endent8, who assassinated \\nthe head of that fiunily as a warning. Shordy afrer, the Don \\nrecovered from his wound and made peace with that pardcular \\n\\n\\n\\nBy 1937 peace and harmony reigned in New York City \\nexcept for minor incidents, minor misunderstandings which \\nwere, of course, sometimes fatal. \\n\\nAs the rulers of \\'ancient cities always kept an anxious eye on \\nthe barbarian tribes roving around their walls, so Don Cor- \\nleone kept an eye on the adairs of the world outside his world. \\nHe noted the coming of Hitler, the £dl of Spain, Germany’s \\nstrong-arming of Britain at Munich. Unblinkered by that out- \\nside world, he saw clearly the coming global wax and he \\nunderstood the implications. His own world would be more im- \\npregnable than before. Not only that, fortunes could be made \\nin time of war by alert, foresighted folk. But to do so peace \\nmust reign in his domain while war raged in the world outside. \\n\\nDon Corleone carried his message through the United \\nStates. He conferred with compatriots in Los Angeles, San \\nFrancisco, Qeyeland, Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, and \\nBoston. He was the underworld apostle of peace and, by 1939, \\nmore successful than any Pope, he had achieved a working \\nagreement amongst the most powerful underworld organiaa- \\ndons in the country. Like the Consdtudon of the United States \\nthis agreement respected fully the internal authority of each \\nmeml^ in his state or city. The agreement covered only \\nspheres of influence and an agreement to enforce peace in the \\nunderworld. \\n\\nAnd so when World War n broke out in 1939, when the \\nUnited States joined the conflict in 1941, the world of Don \\n\"Vito Corleone was at peace, in order, f^iy prepared to reap the \\ngolden harvest on equal terms with all the other industries of a \\nbooming Amenca. The Corleone Family had a hand in sup- \\nplying black-market OP A food stamps, gasoline stamps, even \\ntiaVd priorities. It could help get war contracts and then help \\nget black-market materials for those garment centre clothing \\nfirms who were not given enough raw material because they \\ndid not have government contracts. He could even get all the \\nyoung men in his organization, those eligihlc for Army draft, \\nexcused from fighting in the foreign war. He did this with the \\naid of doctors who advised what drugs had to be taken before \\nphysical examination, or by placing the men in draft-exempt \\npositions in the war industries. \\n\\n228 \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd 80 the Don could take pride in his rule. His world was \\nsafe for those who had sworn their loyalty to him; other men \\nwho believed in law and order were dying by the millions. The \\nonly dy in the ointment was that his own son, Michael Cor- \\nleone, refused to be helped, insisted on volunteering to serve \\nhis own country. And to the Don^s astonishment, so did a few \\nof his other young men in the organization. One of the men, \\ntrying to explain this to his caporegi^e^ said, \"This country has \\nbeen good to me.’ Upon this story being relayed to the Don he \\nsaid angrily to the caporegim^ have been good to him.’ It \\nmight have gone badly for these people but, as he had excused \\nhis son Michael, so must he excuse other young men who so \\nmisunderstood their duty to their Don and to themselves. \\n\\nAt the end of World War II Don Corleone knew that again \\nhis world would have to change its ways, that it would have to \\nfit itself more snugly into the ways of the other, larger world. \\nHe believed he could do this with no loss of profit. \\n\\nThere was reason for this belief in his own experience. What \\nhad put him on the right track were two personal aflairs. \\nEarly in his career the then-young Nazorine, only a baker’s \\nhelper planning to get married, had come to him for assistance. \\nHe and his future bride, a good Italian girl, had saved their \\nmoney and had paid the enormous sum of thrte hundred \\ndollars to a wholesaler of furniture recommended to them. \\nThis wholesaler had let them pick out everything they wanted \\nto furnish their tenement apartment. A fine sturdy bedroom set \\nwith two bureaux and lamps. Also the living room set of heavy \\nstufied sofii and stuffed armchairs, all covered with rich gold- \\nthreaded fabric. Nazorine and his fianc6e had spent a happy \\nday picking out what they wanted from the huge •warehouse \\ncrowded with furniture. The wholesaler took their money, \\ntheir three hundred dollars wrung from the sweat of their \\nblood, and pocketed it and promised the furniture to be de- \\nlivered within the week to the already rented flat. \\n\\nThe very next week however, the firm had gone into bank- \\nruptcy. The great warehouse stocked with furniture had been \\nsealed shut and attached for payment of creditors. The whole- \\nsaler had disappeared to give other creditors time to unleash \\ntheir anger on the empty air. Nazorine, one of these, went to \\n\\n\\n229 \\n\\n\\n\\nhis kwyer, who told him nothing could be done until the case \\nwas setded in court and all creditors satisfied. This might take \\nthree years and Nazorine would be lucky to get back ten cents \\non the dollar. \\n\\nVito Corleone listened to this story with amtised disbelief. \\nIt was not possible that the law could allow such thievery. The \\nwholesaler owned his own palatial home, an estate in Long \\nIsland, a luxurious automobile, and was sending his children \\nto college. How could he keep the three hundred dollars of \\nthe poor baker Nazorine and not give him the furniture he had \\npaid for? But, to make sure, Vito Corleone had Genco \\nAbbandando check it out with the lawyers who represented \\nthe Genco Pura company. \\n\\nThey verified the story of Nazorine. The wholesaler had all \\nhis personal wealth in his wife’s name. His furniture business \\nwas incorporated and he was not personally liable. True, he \\nhad shown bad faith by taking the money of Nazorine when he \\nknew he was going to file bankruptcy but this was a common \\npractice. Under law there was nothing to be done. \\n\\nOf course the matter was easily adjusted. Don Corleone sent \\nhis Consiglioriy Genco Abbandando, to speak to the wholesaler, \\nand as was to be expected, that wide-awake businessman \\ncaught the drift immediately and arranged for Nazorine to get \\nhis furniture. But it was an interesting lesson for the young \\nVito Corleone. \\n\\nThe second incident had more far-reaching repercussions. \\nIn 1939, Don Corleone had decided to move his family out of \\nthe city. Like any other parent he wanted his children to go to \\nbetter schools and mix with better companions. For his own \\npersonal reasons he wanted the anonymity of suburban life \\nwhere his reputation was not known. He bought the mall \\nproperty in Long Beach, which at that time had only four \\nnewly built houses but with plenty of room for more. Sonny \\nwas formally engaged to Sandra and would soon marry, one of \\nthe houses would be for him. One of the houses was for the \\nDon. Another was for Genco Abbandando and his family. \\nThe other was kept vacant at the time. \\n\\nA week after the mall was occupied, a group of three work- \\nmen came in all innocence with their truck. They claimed to be \\n\\n\\n230 \\n\\n\\n\\nfurnace inspectors for the town of Long Beach. One of the \\nDon’s young bodyguards let the men in and led them to the \\nfurnace in the basement. The Don, his wife and Sonny were in \\nthe garden taking their ease and enjoying the salty sea air. \\n\\nMuch to the Don’s annoyance he was summoned into the \\nhouse by his bodyguard. The three workmen, all big burly \\nfellows, were grouped around the furnace. They had taken it \\napart, it was strewn around the cement basement floor. The \\nleader, an authoritative man, said to the Don in a gruff voice, \\n‘ Your furnace is in lousy shape. If you want us to fix it and put \\nit together again, it’ll cost you one hundred fifty dollars for \\nlabour and parts and then we’ll pass you for county inspec- \\ntion.’ He took out a red paper label. ‘We stamp this seal on it, \\nsee, then nobody from the county bothers you again.’ \\n\\nThe Don was amused. It had been a boring, quiet week in \\nwhich he had had to neglect his business to take care of such \\nfamily details moving to a new house entailed. In more broken \\nEnglish than his usual slight acc^^nt he asked, ‘If I don’t pay \\nyou, what happens to my furnace? ’ \\n\\nThe leader of the three men shrugged. ‘We just leave the \\nfurnace the way it is now.’ He gestured at the metal parts \\nstrewn over the floor. \\n\\nThe Don said meekly, ‘Wait, I’ll get you your money.’ Then \\nhe went out into the garden and said to Sonny, ‘Listen, there’s \\nsome men working on the furnace, I don’t understand what \\nthey want. Go in and take care of the matter.’ It was not \\nsimply a joke; he was considering making his son his under- \\nboss. This was one of the tests a business executive had to \\npass. \\n\\nSonny’s solution did not altogether please his father. It was \\ntoo direct, too lacking in Sicilian subtleness. He was the \\nQub, not the Rapier. For as soon as Sonny heard the leader’s \\ndemand he held the three men at gunpoint and had them \\nthoroughly bastinadoed by the bodyguards. Then he made \\nthem put the furnace together again and tidy up the basement. \\nHe searched them and found that they actually were employed \\nby a house-improvement firm with headquarters in Suffolk \\nCounty. He learned the name of the man who owned the firm. \\nThen he kicked the three men to their truck. ‘ Don’t let me see \\n\\n\\n\\nyou in l^ong Beach again/ he told them. \\'I’ll have your bails \\nhanging from your cars.’ \\n\\nIt was typical of the young Santtno^ before he became older \\nand crueller, that he extended his protection to the com- \\nmunity he lived in. Sonny paid a personal call to the home- \\nimprovement firm owner and told him not to send any of his \\nmen into the Long Beach area ever again. As soon as the \\nCorlcone Family set up their usual business liaison with the \\nlocal police force they were informed of all such complaints \\nand all crimes by professional criminals. In less than a year \\nLong Beach became the most crime-free town of its sixe in the \\nUnited States. Professional sdek-up artists and sttong-arms \\nreceived one warning not to piy their trade in the town. They \\nwere ailow\\'eci one ohence. V/hen ttiey comm.nred a seconn they \\nsimply disappeared. The himfi^m home-improvement gyp \\nartists, i-he door-lo-door con men were politely warned that \\nthey were not welcome in Long Beach. Those conhdent con \\nmen who disregaraed the wanimg were beaten within an mch \\nof theii lives. Resident young punks wno iiad no respect for \\nlaw and proper authority were advnsed in the most fatherly \\nfashion to run away from borne. j.ong Beaca became a model \\ncity. \\n\\nWhat impressed the T‘>r»ri was the legal validity of these sales \\nswindles. Clearly there was a place for a man of his talents in \\nthat other world which had been closed to him as an honest \\nyouth, l ie took appropriate steps to enter that world. \\n\\nAnd so he lived happily on tlie mail in Long Beach, con- \\nsolidating and enlarging his empire, until after the war was \\nover, the Turk Sollozzo broke the peace and plunged the \\nDon’s world into its own >var, and brought liim to his hospital \\nbed. \\n\\n\\n\\nBook IV \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN \\n\\nIn the New Hampshire village, every foreign phenomenon \\nwas properly noticed by housewives peering from windows, \\nstorekeepers lounging behind their doors. And so when the \\nblack automobile bearing New York licence plates stopped in \\nfront of the Adams* home, every citkzen knew about it in a \\nmatter of minutes. \\n\\nKay Adams, really a small-town girl despite her college \\neducation, was also peering from her bedroom window. She \\nhad been studying for her exams and preparing to go down- \\nstairs for lunch when she spotted the car coming up the street, \\nanci for some reason she was not surprised when it rolled to \\na halt in front of her lawn. Two men got out, big burly men \\nwho looked like gangsters in the movies to her eyes, and she \\nflew down the stairs to be the first at the door. She was sure \\nthey came from Michael or his family and she didn’t want \\nthem talking to her father and mother without any introduc- \\ntion. It wasn’t that she was ashamed of any of Mike’s friends, \\nshe thought; it was just that her mother and father were old- \\nfiishioned New England Yankees and wouldn’t understand \\nher even knowing such people. \\n\\nShe got to the door just as the bell rang and she called to her \\nmother, \\'I’ll get it. ’ She opened the door and the two big mai \\nstood there. One reached inside his breast pocket like a gang- \\nster reaching for a gun and the move so surprised Kay that she \\nlet out a little gasp but the man had taken out a sm^ leather \\ncase which he flapped open to show an identification card. \\n‘I’m Detective John Phillips from the New York Police De- \\npartment,’ he said. He motioned to the other man, a dark- \\ncomplexioned man with very thick, very black eyebrows. \\n‘This is my partner. Detective Siriani. Are you Miss Kay \\nAdams?’ \\n\\n\\n\\nKay nodded. Phillips said, ‘May we come in and talk to you \\nfor a few minutes. It’s about Michael Corlcone.’ \\n\\nShe stood aside to let them in. At that moment her father \\nappeared in the small side hall that led to his study. ‘Kay, what \\nis it?’ he asked. \\n\\nHer father was a grey-haired, slender, distinguished-looking \\nman wlio not only was the pastor of the town Baptist church \\nbut had a reputation in religious circles as a scholar. Kay really \\ndidn’t know her father well, he puzzled her, but she knew he \\nloved her even if he gave the impression he found her un- \\ninteresting as a person. Though they had never been close, she \\ntrusted him. So she said simply, ‘These men are detectives \\nfrom New York. They want to ask me questions about a boy \\nI know.’ \\n\\nMr Adams didn’t seem surprised. ‘Why don’t we go into my \\nstudy?’ he said. \\n\\nDetective Phillips said gently, *We’d rather talk to your \\ndaughter alone, Mr Adams.’ \\n\\nMr Adams said courteously, ‘That depends on Kay, I think. \\nMy dear, would you rather speak to these gentlemen alone or \\nwould you prefer to have me present? Or perhaps your \\nmother?’ \\n\\nKay shook her head. ‘I’ll talk to them alone.’ \\n\\nMr Adams said to Phillips, ‘You can use my study. Will you \\nstay for lunch?’ The two men shook their heads. Kay led them \\ninto the study. \\n\\nThey rested uncomfortably on the ^dge of the couch as she \\nsat in her father’s big leather chair. Detective Phillips opened \\nthe conversation by saying, ‘Miss Adams, have you seen or \\nheard from Michael Corleone at any time in the last three \\nwecics?* The one question was enough to warn her. Three \\nweeks ago she had read the Boston newspapers with their \\nheadlines about the killing of a New York police captain and a \\nnarcotics smuggler named Virgil Sollozzo. The newspaper had \\nsaid it was part of the gang war involving the Corleone Family. \\n\\nKay shook her head. ‘No, the last time 1 saw him he was \\ngoing to see his father in the hospital. That was periiaps a \\nmonth ago/ \\n\\nThe other detective said in a harsh voice, ‘We know all \\n\\n*54 \\n\\n\\n\\nabout that meeting. Have you seen or heard from him since \\nthen?\\' \\n\\n‘No/ Kay said. \\n\\nDetective Phillips said in a polite voice, ‘ If you do have con- \\ntact with him we*d like you to let us know. It’s very important \\nwe get to talk to Michael Corlconc. I must warn you that if \\nyou do have contact with him you may be getting involved in \\na very dangerous situation. If you help him in any way, you \\nmay get yourself in very serious trouble.’ \\n\\nKay sat up very straight in the chair. ‘ Why shouldn’t I help \\nhim?’ she asked. ‘We’re going to be married, married people \\nhelp each other.* \\n\\nIt was Detective Siriani who answered her. ‘If you help, you \\nmay be an accessory to murder. We’re looking for your boy- \\nfriend because he kiUed a police captain in New York plus an \\ninformer the police officer was contacting. We know Michael \\nCorleone is the person who did the shooting.’ \\n\\nKay laughed. Her laughter was so unaffected, so incredulous, \\nthat the officers were impressed. ‘Mike wouldn’t do anything \\nlike that,’ she said. ‘He never had anything to do with his \\nfamily. When we went to his sister’s wedding it was obvious \\nthat he was treated as an outsider, almost as much as I was. If \\nhe’s hiding now it’s just so that he won’t get any publicity, so \\nhis name won’t be dragged through all this. Mike is not a \\ngangster. I know him better than you or anybody else can \\nknow him. He is too nice a man to do anything as despicable \\nas murder. He is the most law-abiding person 1 know, and I’ve \\nnever known him to lie..’ \\n\\nDetective Phillips asked gently, ‘ How long hav^ you known \\nhim?’ \\n\\n‘Over a year,* Kay said and was surprised when the two \\nmen smiled. \\n\\n‘I think there are a few things you should know,’ Detective \\nPhillips said. ‘On the night he left you, he went to the hos- \\npital. When he came out he got into an argument with a police \\ncaptain who had come to the hospital on official business. He \\nassaulted that police officer but got the worst of it. In fact he \\ngot a broken jaw and lost some teeth. His friends took him out \\nto the Corleone Family houses at Long Beach. The following \\n\\n\\n^55 \\n\\n\\n\\nnight the police captain he had the fight with was gunned \\ndown and Michael Corleone disappeared. Vanished. We have \\nour contacts, our informers. They all point the finger at \\nMichael Corleone but we have no evidence for a court of \\nlaw. The waiter who witnessed the shooting doesn’t recognize \\na picture of Mike but he may recognize him in person. And we \\nhave Sollozzo’s driver, who refuses to talk, but we might \\nmake him talk if we have Michael Corleone in our hands. So \\nwe have all our people looking for him, the FBI is looking \\nfor him, everybody is looking for him. So far, no luck, so we \\nthought you might be able to give us a lead.’ \\n\\nKay said coldly, ‘I don’t believe a word of it.’ But she felt a \\nbit sick knowing the part about Mike getting his jaw broken \\nmust be true. Not that that would make Mike commit murder. \\n\\n‘Will you let us know if Mike contacts you?’ Phillips asked. \\n\\nKay shook her head. The other detective, Siriani, said \\nroughly, ‘We know you two have been shacking up together. \\nWe have the hotel records and witnesses. If we let that infor- \\nmation slip to the newspapers your father and mother would \\nfeel pretty lousy. Real respectable people like them wouldn’t \\nthink much of a daughter shacking up with a gangster. If you \\ndon’t come clean right now I’ll call your old man in here and \\ngive it to him straight.’ \\n\\nKay looked at him with astonishment. Then she got up and \\nwent to the door of the study and opened it. She could see her \\nfather standing at the living-room window, sucking at bis pipe. \\nShe called out, ‘Dad, can you join us?’ He turned, smiled at \\nher, and walked to the study. When he came through the door \\nhe put his arm around his daughter’s waist and faced the \\ndetectives and said, ‘Yes, gentlemen?’ \\n\\nWhen they didn’t answer, Kay said coolly to Detective \\nSiriani, ‘Give it to him straight, officer.’ \\n\\nSiriani flushed. ‘Mr Adams, I’m telling you this for your \\ndaughter’s good. She is mixed up with a hoodlum we have \\nreason to believe committed a murder on a police officer. I’m \\njust telHng her she can get into serious trouble unless she co^ \\noperates with us. But she doesn’t seem to realize how serious \\nthis whole matter is. Maybe you can talk to her.’ \\n\\n‘That is quite incredible/ Mr Adams said politely. \\n\\nZ56 \\n\\n\\n\\nSiriani Jutted his jaw. * Your daughter and Michael Cotleonc \\nhave been going out together for over a year. They have \\nstayed overnight in hotels together registered as man and wife. \\nMichael Q>rleonc is wanted for questioning in the murder of \\na police officer. Your daughter refuses to give us any infor- \\nmation that may help us. Those are the facts. You can call \\nthem incredible but I can back everything up.’ \\n\\n*1 don’t doubt your word, sir,’ Mr Adams said gently. \\n* What 1 find incredible is that my daughter could be in serious \\ntrouble. Unless you’re suggesting that she is a ’ - here his face \\nbecame one of scholarly doubt - ‘a “moll”, I believe it’s \\ncalled.’ \\n\\nKay looked at her father in astonishment. She knew he was \\nbeing playful in his donnish way and she was surprised that he \\ncould take the whole affair so lightly. \\n\\nMr Adams said firmly, ’However, rest assured that if the \\nyoung man shows his face here I shall immediately report his \\npresence to the authorities. As will my daughter. Now, if you \\nwill forgive us, our lunch is growing cold.’ \\n\\nHe ushered the men out of the house with every courtesy \\nand closed the door on their backs gently but firmly. He took \\nKay by the arm and led her towards the kitchen far in the rear of \\nthe house, ’ Come, my dear, your mother is waiting lunch for us.’ \\n\\nBy the time they reached the kitchen, Kay was weeping \\nsilently, out of relief from strain, at her father’s unquestiomng \\naffection. In the kitchen her mother took no notice of her weep- \\ning, and Kay realiaed that her father must have told her about \\nthe two detectives. She sat down at her place and her \\nmother served her silently. When all three were at the table \\nher father said grace with bowed head. \\n\\nMrs Adams was a short stout woman always neatly dressed, \\nhair always set. Kay had never seen her in disarray. Her mother \\ntoo had always been a little disinterested in her, holding her at \\narm’s length. And she did so now. ’Kay, stop bemg so \\ndramatic. I’m sure it’s all a great deal of fiiss about nothing \\nat all. After aH, the boy was a Dartmouth boy, he couldn’t \\npossibly be mheed up in anything so sordid.’ \\n\\nKay looked op in surprise. ’How did you know Mike went \\nto Dartmouth \\n\\n\\n*37 \\n\\n\\n\\nKcr mother said complacently, *You young people are so \\nmysterious, you think you’re so clever. We’ve known about \\nhim all along, but of course we couldn’t bring it up until you \\ndid.’ \\n\\n‘But how did you know?’ Kay asked. She still couldn’t face \\nher father now that he knew about her and Mike sleeping \\ntogether. So she didn’t see the smile on his face when he said, \\n‘We opened your mail, of course.’ \\n\\nKay was horrified and angry. Now she could face him. What \\nhe had done was more shameful than her own sin. She could \\nnever believe it of him. * Father, you didn’t, you couldn’t have.’ \\n\\nMr Adams smiled at her. ‘I debated which was the greater \\nsin, opening your mail, or going in ignorance of some hazard \\nmy only child might be incurring. The choice was simple, and \\nvirtuous.’ \\n\\nMrs Adams said between mouthfuls of boiled chicken, \\n‘After all, my dear, you are terribly innocent for your age. \\nWe had to be aware. And you never spoke about him.’ \\n\\nFor the first time Kay was grateful that Michael was never \\naffectionate in his letters. She was grateful that her parents \\nhadn’t seen some of her letters. ‘I never told you about him \\nbecause I thought you’d be horrified about his family.’ \\n\\n‘We were,’ Mr Adams said cheerfully. ‘By the way, has \\nMichael got in touch with you?’ \\n\\nKay shook her head. ‘ I don’t believe he’s guilty of anything.* \\n\\nShe saw her parents exchange a glance over the table. Then \\nMr Adams said gently, ‘If he’s not guilty and he’s vanished, \\nthen perhaps something else happened to him.’ \\n\\nAt first Kay didn’t understand. Then she got up from the \\ntable and ran to her room. \\n\\nThree days later Kay Adams got out of a taxi in front of the \\nCorleone mall in Long Beach. She had phoned, she was ex- \\npected. Tom Hagen met her at the door and she was disap- \\npointed that it was him. She knew he would tell her nothing. \\n\\nIn the living ro om he gave her a drink. She had seen a \\ncouple of other men lounging around the house but not \\nSonny. She asked Tom Hagen directly, ‘Do you know where \\nMike is? Do you know where I can get in touch with him?* \\n\\n238 \\n\\n\\n\\nHagen said smoothly, ‘ Wc know he’s all right but wc don’t \\nknow where he is right now. When he heard about that cap- \\ntain being shot he was afraid they’d accuse him. So he just \\ndecided to disappear. He told me he’d get in touch in a few \\nmonths.’ \\n\\nThe story was not only false but meant to be seen through, \\nhe was giving her that much. ‘Did that captain really break \\nhis jaw?’ Kay asked. \\n\\n‘I’m afraid that’s true,’ Tom said. ‘But Mike was never a \\nvindictive man. I’m sure that had nothing to do with what \\nhappened.’ \\n\\nKay opened her purse and took out a letter. ‘ Will you de- \\nliver this to him if he gets in touch with you?’ \\n\\nHagen shook his head. ‘If I accepted that letter and you \\ntold a court of law I accepted that letter, it might be interpreted \\nas my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Why don’t you \\njust wait a bit? I’m sure Mike will get in touch.’ \\n\\nShe finished her drink and got up to leave. Hagen escorted \\nher to the hall but as he opened the door, a woman came in \\nfrom outside. A short, stout woman dressed in black. Kay \\nrecognized her as Michael’s mother. She held out her hand and \\nsaid, ‘How are you, Mrs G>rleone?’ \\n\\nThe woman’s small black eyes darted at her for a moment, \\nthen the wrinkled, leathery, olive-skinned face broke into a \\nsmall curt smile of greeting that was yet in some curious way \\ntruly friendly. ‘Ah, you Mikey’s little girl,’ Mrs Corleone said. \\nShe had a heavy Italian accent, Kay could barely understand \\nher. ‘You eat something?’ Kay said no, meaning she didn’t \\nwant anything to eat, but Mrs Corleone turned furiously on \\nTom Hagen and berated him in Italian endings with, ‘You \\ndon’t even give this poor girl coffee, you disgjra:(ia* She took \\nKay by the hand, the old woman’s hand surprisingly warm and \\nalive, and led her into the kitchen. ‘You have coffee and eat \\nsomething, then somebody drive you home. A nice girl like \\nyou, I don’t want you to take the train.’ She made Kay sit \\ndown and bustled around the kitchen, tearing off her coat and \\nhat and draping them over a chair. In a few seconds there was \\nbread and cheese and salami on the table and coffee perking \\non the stove. \\n\\n\\n239 \\n\\n\\n\\nKay said timidly, ‘I came to ask about Mike, I haven’t heard \\nfrom him. Mr Hagen said nobody knows where he is, that he*]] \\nturn up in a little while.’ \\n\\nHagen spoke quickly, ‘That’s all we can tell her now, Ma.’ \\n\\nMrs Corleone gave him a look of withering contempt. ‘Now \\nyou gonna tell me what to do? My husband don’t tell me what \\nto do, God have mercy on him.’ She crossed herself. \\n\\n‘Is Mr Corleone all right?* Kay asked. \\n\\n‘Fine,’ Mrs Corleone said. ‘Fine. He’s getting old, he’s get- \\nting foolish to let something like that happen.’ She tapped her \\nhead disrespectfully. She poured the coffee and forced Kay to \\neat some bread and cheese. \\n\\nAfter they drank their coffee Mrs Corleone took one of \\nKay’s hands in her two brown ones. She said quietly, ‘Mikey \\nno gonna write you, you no gonna hear from Mikey. He hide \\ntwo-three years. Maybe more, maybe much more. You go \\nhome to your family and find a nice young fellow and get \\nmarried.’ \\n\\nKay took the letter out of her purse. * Will you send this to \\nhim?’ \\n\\nThe old lady took the letter and patted Kay on the cheek. \\n\\n‘ Sure, sure,’ she said. Hagen started to protest and she screamed \\nat him in Italian. Then she led Kay to the door. There she \\nkissed her on the cheek very quickly and said, ‘You forget \\nabout Mikey, he no the man for you any more.’ \\n\\nThere was a car waiting for her with two men up front. \\nThey drove her all the way to her hotel in New York never \\nsaying a word. Neither did Kay. She was trying to get used to \\nthe fact that the young man she had loved was a cold-blooded \\nmurderer. And that she had been told by the most unim- \\npeachable source: his mother. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN \\n\\nCarlo Kizzi was punk sore at the world. Once married into \\nthe Corleone Family, he’d been shunted aside with a small \\nbookmaker’s business on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. \\n\\n\\n240 \\n\\n\\n\\nHc*d counted on one of the houses in the mall on Long Beach, \\nhe knew the Don could move retainer families out when he \\npleased and he had been sure it would happen and be would \\nbe on the inside of everything. But the Don wasn’t treating \\nhim right. The ‘ Great Don*, he thought with scorn. An old \\nMoustache Pete who’d been caught out on the street by gun- \\nmen like any dumb small-time hood. He hoped the old bastard \\ncroaked. Sonny had been his friend once and if Sonny became \\nthe head of the Family maybe he’d get a break, get on the \\ninside. \\n\\nHe watched his wife pour his coffee. Christ, what a mess she \\nturned out to be. Five months of marriage and she was already \\nspreading, besides blowing up. Real guinea broads all these \\nItalians in the East. \\n\\nHe reached out and felt Connie’s soft spreading buttocks. \\nShe smiled at him and he said contemptuously, ‘You got more \\nham than a hog.’ It pleased him to see the hurt look on her \\nface, the tears springing into her eyes. She might be a daughter \\nof the Great Don but she was his wife, she was his property \\nnow and he could treat her as he pleased. It made him feel \\npowerful that one of the Corlcones was his doormat. \\n\\nHe had started her off just right. She had tried to keep that \\npurse full of money presents for herself and he had given her \\na nice black eye and taken the money from her. Never told \\nher what he’d done with it, cither. That might have rcaUy \\ncaused some trouble. Even now he felt just the slightest \\ntwinge of remorse. Christ, he’d blown nearly fifteen grand on \\nthe track and show girl bimbos. \\n\\nHe could feel Connie watching his back and so he flexed his \\nmuscles as he reached for the plate of sweet buns oa the other \\nside of the table. He’d just polished off ham and eggs but he \\nwas a big man and needed a big breakfast. He was pleased with \\nthe picture he knew he presented to his wife. Not the usual \\ngreasy dark guin^o husband but crew-cut blond, huge golden- \\nhaired forearms and broad shoulders and thin waist. And he \\nknew he was physically stronger than any of those so-called \\nhard guys that worked for the fiuxiily. Guys like Qcmenza, \\nTessio, Rocco Lampone, and that guy PauUe that somebody \\nhad knocked off. He wondered what the story was about that. \\n\\n\\n241 \\n\\n\\n\\nThen for some reason he thought about Sonny. Man to man \\nhe could take Sonny, he thought, even though Sonny was a \\nlittle bigger and a little heavier. But what scared him was \\nSonny’s rep, though he himself had never seen Sonny anything \\nbut good-natured and kidding around. Yeah, Sonny was his \\nbuddy. Maybe with the old Don gone, things would open up. \\n\\nHe dawdled over his coffee. He hated this apartment. He \\nwas used to the bigger living quarters of the West and in a \\nlittle wliile he would have to go crosstown to his ‘book* to \\nrun the noontime action. It was a Sunday, the heaviest action \\nof the week what with baseball going already and the tail end \\nof basketball and the night trotters starting up. Gradually he \\nbecame aware of Connie bustling around behind him and he \\nturned his head to watch her. \\n\\nShe was getting dressed up in the real New York City \\nguin20 style that he hated. A silk flowered-pattern dress with \\nbelt, showy bracelet and earrings, flouncy sleeves. She looked \\ntwenty years older. ‘Where the hell are you going?* he asked. \\n\\nShe answered him coldly, ‘To see my father out in Long \\nBeach. He still can’t get out of bed and he needs company.* \\nCarlo was curious. ‘Is Sonny still running the show?* \\nConnie gave him a bland look. ‘What show?* \\n\\nHe was furious. ‘You lousy little guinea bitch, don’t talk to \\nme like that or I’ll beat that kid right out of your belly.* She \\nlooked frightened and this enraged him even more. He sprang \\nfrom his chair and slapped her across the face, the blow leaving \\na red welt. With quick precision he slapped her three more \\ntimes. He saw her upper lip split bloody and pufi\" up. That \\nstopped him. He didn’t want to leave a mark. She ran into the \\nbedroom and slammed the door and he heard the key turning \\nin the lock. He laughed and returned to his coffee. \\n\\nHe smoked until it was time for him to dress. He knocked \\non the door and said, ‘Open it up before I kick it in.’ There \\nwas no answer. ‘Come on, I gotta get dressed,* he said in a \\nloud voice. He could hear her getting up off the bed and com- \\ning towards the door, then the key turned in the lock. When he \\nentered she had her back to him, walking back towards the \\nbed, lying down on it with her face turned away to the wall. \\nHe dressed quickly and then saw she was in her slip. He \\n\\n\\n242 \\n\\n\\n\\nwanted her to go visit her &ther, he hoped she would bring \\nback information. *What’s the matter, a few slaps take all the \\nenergy out of you?’ She was a lazy slut. \\n\\n‘I don’t wanna go.’ Her voice was tearful, the words mum- \\nbled. He reached out impatiently and pulled her around to face \\nhim. And then he saw why she didn’t want to go and thought \\nmaybe it was just as well. \\n\\nHe must have slapped her harder than he figured. Her left \\ncheek was blown up, the cut upper lip ballooned grotesquely \\npufiy and white beneath her nose. ‘OK,’ he said, ‘but I won’t \\nbe home until late. Sunday is my busy day.’ \\n\\nHe left the apartment and found a parking ticket on his car, \\na fifteen-dollar green one. He put it in the glove compartment \\nwith the stack of others. He was in a good humour. Slapping \\nthe spoiled litde bitch around always made him feel good. It \\ndissolved some of the frustration he felt at being treated so \\nbadly by the Corleones. \\n\\nThe ftrst time he had marked her up, he’d been a little wor- \\nried. She had gone right out to Long Beach to complain to her \\nmother and father and to show her black eye. He had really \\nsweated it out. But when she came back she had been sur- \\nprisingly meek, the dutiful little Italian wife. He had made it a \\npoint to be the perfect husband over the next few weeks, \\ntreating her well in every way, being lovey and nice with her, \\nbanging her every day, morning and night. Finally she had \\ntold him what had happened since she thought he would never \\nact that way again. \\n\\nShe had found her parents coolly unsympathetic and \\ncuriously amused. Her mother had had a little sympathy and \\nhad even asked her father to speak to Carlo Rkzi. Her father \\nhad refused. ‘She is my daughter,’ he had said, *but now she \\nbelongs to her husband. He knows his duties. Even the King \\nof Italy didn’t dare to meddle with the relationship of husband \\nand wife. Go home and learn how to behave so that he will not \\nbeat you.’ \\n\\nConnie had said angrily to her father, ‘Did you ever hit your \\nwife?’ She was his fiavourite and could speak to him so im- \\npudently. He had answered, ‘She never gave me reason to \\nbeat her.’ And her mother had nodded and smiled. \\n\\n\\n*45 \\n\\n\\n\\nShe told them how her husband had taken the wedding \\npresent money and never told her what he did with it. Her \\nfether had shrugged and said, *1 would have done the same if \\nmy wife had been as presumptuous as you/ \\n\\nAnd so she had returned home, a little bewildered, a little \\nfnghtened. She had always been her father’s favourite and she \\ncould not understand his coldness now. \\n\\nBut the Don had not been so unsympathetic as he pretended. \\nHe made inquiries and found out what Carlo Rhszi had done \\nwith the wedding present money. He had men assigned to \\nCarlo Rizzi’s bookmaking operation who would report to \\nHagen everything Rirzi did on the job. But the Don could not \\ninterfere. How expect a man to discbaree his husbandly duties \\nto a wife whose family be feared ? Tt was an impossible situ- \\nation and he dared not meddle. Then when Connie became \\npregnant he was convinced of the wisdom of his decision and \\nfelt he never could interfere though Connie complained to her \\nmother about a few more beatings and the mother finally be- \\ncame concerned enough to mention it to the Don. Connie even \\nhinted that she might want a divorce. For the first time in her \\nlife the Don was angry with her. *He is the father of your \\nchild. What can a child come to in this world if he has no \\nfather?’ he said to Connie. \\n\\nLearning all this. Carlo Rizzi grew confident. He was per- \\nfectly safe. In fact he bragged to his two \\' writers ’ on the book, \\nSally Ri* . s and Coach, about how he bounced his wife around \\nwhen she got snotty and saw their looks of respect that he had \\nthe guts to manhandle the daughter of the great Don Corleone. \\n\\nBut Rizzi would not have felt so safe if he had known that \\nwhen Sonny Corleone learned of the beatings be had flown \\ninto a murderous rage and had been restrained only by the \\nsternest and most imperious command of the Don himself, a \\ncommand that even Sonny dared not disobey. Which was why \\nSonny avoided Rizzi, not trusting himself to control his temper. \\n\\nSo feeling perfectly safe on this beautiful Sunday morning. \\nCarlo Rizzi sped crosstown on 96th Street to the East Side. He \\ndid not see Sonny’s car coming the opposite way towards his \\nhouse. \\n\\n\\n41 9|t \\n\\n\\n*44 \\n\\n\\n\\nSonny CodecMie had left the protection of the mall and spent \\nthe night with Lucy Mandni in town. Now on the way home \\nhe was travelling with four bodyguards^ two in front and two \\nbehind. He didn\\'t need guards right beside him, he could take \\ncare of a single direct assault. The other men travelled in their \\nown cars and had apartments on either side of Lucy\\'s apart- \\nment. It was safe to visit her as long as he didn\\'t do it too often. \\nBut now that he was in town he figured he would pick up his \\nsister ODnnie and take her out to Long Beach. He ^ew Carlo \\nwould be working at his book and the cheap bastard wouldn\\'t \\nget her a car. So he\\'d give his sister a lift out. \\n\\nHe waited for the two men in front to go into the building \\nand then followed them. He saw the two men in back pull up \\nbehind his car and get out to watch the streets. He kept his \\nown eyes open. It was a million-to-one shot that the opposi- \\ntion even knew he was in town but he was always carefuL He \\nhad learned that in the 1930s w^. \\n\\nHe never used elevators. They were death traps. He climbed \\nche eight flights to Connie\\'s apartment, going fast. He knocked \\non her door. He had seen Carlo\\'s car go by and knew she wodd \\nbe alone. There was no answer. He knocked again and then he \\nheard his sister\\'s voice, frightened, timid, asking, ‘Who is it?\\' \\n\\n‘Ihe fright in the voice stunned hhn. His kid sister had always \\nbeen fresh and snotty, tough as anybody in the family. What \\nthe hell had happened to her? He said, ‘It\\'s Sonny. \\' The bolt \\ninside slid back and the door opened and Connie was in his \\nanns sobbing. He was so surprised he just stood there. He \\npushed her away from him and saw her swollen free and he \\nunderstood what had happened. \\n\\nHe pulled away from her to run down the stairs and go after \\nher husband. Rage flamed up in him, contorting his own free. \\nConnie saw the rage and clung to him, not letting him go, \\nmaking him come into the apartment. She was weeping out of \\nterror now. She knew her older brother\\'s temper and feared it. \\nShe had never complained to him about Carlo for that reason. \\nNow she made him come into the apartment with her. \\n\\n‘It was my fruit,\\' she said. ‘I start^ a fight with him and I \\ntried to hit 1 ^ so he hit me. He really didn\\'t try to hit me that \\nhard. I walked into it.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSonny’s heavy Cupid face was under control. * You going to \\nsee the old man today?’ \\n\\nShe didn’t answer, so he added, ‘I thought you were, so 1 \\ndropped over to give you a lift. I was in the city anyway.’ \\n\\nShe shook her head. ‘1 don’t want them to see me this way. \\nrU come next week.*\\' \\n\\n*OK,’ Sonny said. He picked up her kitchen phone and \\ndialled a number. ‘I’m getting a doctor to come over here and \\ntake a look at you and £x you up. In your condition you have to \\nbe careful. How many months before you have the kid?’ \\n\\n‘Two months,’ Connie said. ‘Sonny, please don’t do any- \\nthing. Please don’t.’ \\n\\nSonny laughed. His face was cruelly intent when he said, \\n‘Don’t worry, I won’t make your kid an orphan before he’s \\nbom.’ He left the apartment after kissing her lightly on her \\nuninjured cheek. \\n\\nOn East 1 1 zth Street a long line of cars were double-parked \\nin front of a candy store that was the headquarters of Carlo \\nRizzi’s book. On the sidewalk in front of the store, fathers \\nplayed catch with small children they had taken for a Sunday \\nmorning ride and to keep them company as they placed their \\nbets. When they saw Carlo Rizzi coming they stopped playing \\nball and bought their kids ice cream to keep them quiet. Then \\nthey started studying the newspapers that gave the starting \\npitchers, trying to pick out winning baseball bets for the day. \\n\\nCarlo went into the large room in the back of the store. His \\ntwo ‘writers’, a small wiry man called Sally Rags and a big \\nhusky fellow called Coach, were already waiting for the action \\nto start. They had their huge lined pads in front of them ready \\nto write down bets. On a wooden stand was a blackboard with \\nthe names of the sixteen big league baseball teams chalked on \\nit, paired to show who was playing against who. Against each \\npairing was a blocked-out square to enter the odds. \\n\\nCarlo asked Coach, ‘Is the store phone tapped today?’ \\n\\nCoach shook his head. ‘The tap is still off.’ \\n\\nCarlo went to the wall phone and dialled a number. Sally \\nRags and Coach watched him impassively as he jotted down \\nthe ‘ line the odds on all the baseball games for that day. They \\n\\n246 \\n\\n\\n\\nwatched him as he hung up the phone and walked over to the \\nblackboard and chalked up the odds against each game. \\nThough Gurlo did not know it, they had already got the line \\nand were checking his work. In the first week in his job Girlo \\nhad made a mistake in transposing the odds on to the black- \\nboard and had created that dream of all gamblers, a * middle’. \\nThat is, by betting the odds with him and then betting against \\nthe same team with another bookmaker at the correct odds, \\nthe gambler could not lose. The only one who could lose was \\nCarlo’s book. That mistake had caused a six-thousand-doUar \\nloss in the book for the week and confirmed the Don’s judge- \\nment about his son-in-law. He had given the word that all of \\nCarlo’s work was to be checked. \\n\\nNormally the highly placed members of the Corleone Family \\nwould never be concerned with such an operational detail. \\nThere was at least a five-layer insulation to their level. But \\nsince the book was being used as a testing ground for the son- \\nin-law, it had been placed under the direct scrutiny of Tom \\nHagen, to whom a report was sent every day. \\n\\nNow with the line posted, the gamblers were thronging into \\nthe back room of the candy store to jot down the odds on their \\nnewspapers next to the games printed there with probable \\npitchers. Some of them held their little children by the hand \\nas they looked up at the blackboard. One guy who made big \\nbets looked down at the litde girl he was holding by the hand \\nand said teasingly, ‘Who do you like today, Honey, Giants or \\nthe Pirates?’ The little girl, fascinated by the colourful names, \\nsaid, ‘Are Giants stronger than Pirates?’ The father laughed. \\n\\nA line began to form in front of the two writers. When a \\nwriter filled one of his sheets he tore it off, wrapped the money \\nhe had collected in it and handed it to Carlo. Carlo went out \\nthe back exit of the room and up a flight of steps to an apart- \\nment which housed the candy store owner’s fainily. He c^ed \\nin the bets to his central exchange and put the money in a \\nsmall wall safe that was hidden by an extended window drape. \\nThen he went back down into the candy store after having \\nfirst burned the bet sheet and flushed its ashes down the toilet \\nbowl. \\n\\nNone of the Sunday games started before two pm because of \\n\\n*47 \\n\\n\\n\\nthe blue laws, so after the first crowd of betters, family men \\nwho had to get their bets in and rush home to take their \\nfamilies to the beach, came the trickling of bachelor gamblers \\nor the diehards who condemned their families to Sundays in \\nthe hot city apartments. These bachelor betters were the big \\ngamblers, they bet heavier and came back around four o\\'^clock \\nto bet the second games of doubleheaders. They were the ones \\nwho made Carlo’s Sundays a full-time day with overtime, \\nthough some married men called in from the beach to try and \\nrecoup their losses. \\n\\nBy one-thirty the betting had trickled off so that Carlo and \\nSally Rags could go out and sit on the stoop beside the candy \\nstore and get some fresh air. They watched the stickhail game \\nthe kids were having. A police car went by. They ignored it. \\nThis book had very heavy j>rotcction at the precinct and \\ncouldn’t be touched on a local level. A raid would have to be \\nordered from the very top and even then a warning would \\ncome through in plenty of time. \\n\\nCoach came out and sat beside them. They gossiped a while \\nabout baseball and women. Carlo said laughingly, *1 had to \\nbat my wife around again today, teach her who’s boss.’ \\n\\nCoach said casually, * She’s knocked up pretty big now, ain’t \\nshe?\\' \\n\\n^Ahh, 1 just slapped her face a few times,’ Carlo said. *1 \\ndidn’t hurt her,’ He brooded for a moment. ‘She thinks she \\ncan boss me around, I don’t stand for that.’ \\n\\nThere were still a few betters hanging around shooting the \\nbreeze, talking baseball, some of them sitting on the steps \\nabove the two writers and Carlo. Suddenly the kids playing \\nstickball in the street scattered. A car came screeching up the \\nblock and to a halt in front of the candy store. It stopped so \\nabruptly that the tyres screamed and before it had stopped, \\nalmost, a man came hurtling out of the driver’s scat, moving \\nso fast that everybody was paralysed. The man was Sonny \\nCorleone. \\n\\nHis heavy Cupid-featured face w ith its thick, curved mouth \\nwas an ugly mask of fury. In a split second he was at the stoop \\nand had grabbed Carlo Rizzi by the throat. He pulled Carlo \\naway from the others, trying to drag him into the street, but \\n\\n248 \\n\\n\\n\\nCarlo wrapped his huge muscular arms around the iron railings \\nof the stoop and hung on. He cringed aw\\'ay, trying to hide his \\nhead and face in the hollow of his shoulders. His shirt ripped \\naway in Sonny’s hand. \\n\\nWhat followed then ^vas sickening. Sonny began heating the \\ncowering Carlo with his hscs, cursing him in a thick, rage- \\nchoked voice. Carlo, despite his tremendous physique, offered \\nno resistance, gave no cry for mercy oi protest. Coach and \\nRags dared not interfere. They thought Sonny meant to \\nkill his brother dn-law and had no desire to share his fate. The \\nkids playing stickhuU gathered to curse the driver who had \\nmade them scatter, but now v ere watching with awestruck \\niatercst. 1 hey were tough kids but the sight of Sonny in his \\nrage silenced them. Meanwhile another car had drawn up \\nbehind Sonny\\'s and two of his bodyguards jumped out. When \\nthey saw what was happening they too dared not interfere. \\nThey stood alert, ready to protect .heir chief if any bystanders \\nhad the stupidity to try to help Carlo. \\n\\nWTiat made the sight sickening was Carlo’s complete subjec- \\ntion, but it was perhaps this that saved his life. He clung to the \\niron railings with his hands so that Sonny could not drag him \\ninto the street and despite his obvious equal strength, still \\nrefused to fight back. He let the blows rain on his unprotected \\nhead and neck until Sonny’s rage ebbed. Finally, his chest \\nheaving. Sonny looked down at him and said, ‘You dirty \\nbastard, you ever beat up my sister again J’ll kill you.’ \\n\\nThese words released the tension. Because of course, if \\nSonny intended to kill the man he would never have uttered \\nthe threat. He uttered it in frustration because he could not \\ncarry it out. Carlo refused to look at Sonny. He kept his head \\ndown and his hands and arms entwined in the iron railing. He \\nstayed that way until the car roared off and he heard Coach say \\nin his curiously paternal voice, *OK, Carlo, come on into the \\nstore. Let’s get out of sight.’ \\n\\nIt was only then that Carlo dared to get out of his orouch \\nagainst the stone steps of the stoop and unlock his hands from \\nthe railing. Standing up, he could see the kids look at him with \\nthe staring, sickened ffices of people who had witnessed the \\ndegradation of a fellow human being. He was a little di22y but \\n\\n\\n^9 \\n\\n\\n\\nit was more from shock, the raw fear that had taken command \\nof his body; he was not badly hurt despite the shower of heavy \\nblows. He let Coach lead him by the arm into the back room \\nof the candy store and put ice on his face, which, though it \\nwas not cut or bleeding, was lumpy with swelling bruises. \\nThe fear was subsiding now and the humiliation he had suffered \\nmade him sick to his stomach so that he had to throw up. \\nCoach held his head over the sink, supported him as if he were \\ndrunk, then helped him upstairs to the apartment and made \\nhim lie down in one of the bedrooms. Carlo never noticed that \\nSally Rags had disappeared. \\n\\nSally Rags iiad walked down to Third Avenue and called \\nRocco Lampone to report what had happened. Rocco took the \\nnews calmly and in his turn called his caporeffme^ Pete Qem- \\nen2a. Clemenza groaned and said, ‘Oh, Christ, that goddamn \\nSonny and his temper,’ but his finger had prudently clicked \\ndown on the hook so that Rocco never heard his remark. \\n\\nClemenza called the house in Long Beach and got Tom \\nHagen. Hagen was silent for a moment and then he said, ‘ Send \\nsome of your people and cars out on the road to Long Beach \\nas soon as you can, just in case Sonny gets held up by traffic or \\nan accident. When he gets sore like that he doesn’t know what \\nthe hell he’s doing. Maybe some of our friends on the other \\nside will hear he was in town. You never can tell.’ \\n\\nClemenza said doubtfully, ‘By the time I could get anybody \\non the road, Sonny will be home. That goes for the Tattaglias \\ntoo.’ \\n\\n‘I know,’ Hagen said patiently. ‘But if something out of the \\nordinary happens. Sonny may be held up. Do the best you can, \\nPete.’ \\n\\nGrudgingly Gemenza called Rocco Lampone and told him \\nto get a few people and cars and cover the road to Long Beach. \\nHe himself went out to his beloved Cadillac and with three of \\nthe platoon of guards who now garrisoned his home, started \\nover the Atlantic Beach Bridge, towards New York Qty. \\n\\nOne of the hangers-on around the candy store, a small better \\non the payroll of the Tattaglia Family as an informer, called the \\ncontact he had with his people. But the Tattaglia Family had \\nnot streamlined itself for the war, the contact had to go aU \\n\\n\\n250 \\n\\n\\n\\nthe way through the insulation layers before he finally got to \\nthe caporegime who contacted the Tattaglia chief. By that time \\nSonny Corleone was safely back in the mall, in his father*s \\nhouse, in Long Beach, about to face his father’s wrath. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN \\n\\nT HE WAR of 1947 between the Corleone Family and the Five \\nFamilies combined against them proved to be expensive for \\nboth sides. It was complicated by the police pressure put on \\neverybody to solve the murder of Captain McQuskcy. It was \\nrare that operating officials of the Police Department ignored \\npolitical muscle that protected gambling and vice operations, \\nbut in this case the politicians were as helpless as the general \\nstaff of a rampaging, looting army whose field officers refuse \\nto follow orders. \\n\\nThis lack of protection did not hurt the Corleone Family as \\nmuch as it did their opponents. The Corleone group depended \\non gambling for most of its income, and was hit especially hard \\nin its ‘numbers* or ‘policy* branch of operations. The runners \\nwho picked up the action were swept into police nets and \\nusually given a medium shellacking before being booked. \\nEven some of the ‘banks * were located and raided, with heavy \\nfinancial loss. The ‘bankers*, .90 calibres in their own right, \\ncomplained to the caporegimeSy who brought thfeir complaints \\nto the family council table. But there was nothing to be done. \\nThe bankers were told to go out of business. Ldcal Negro \\nfreelancers were allowed to take over the operation in Harlem, \\nthe richest territory, and they operated in such scattered fashion \\nthat the police found it hard to pin them down. \\n\\nAfter the death of Captain McQuskey, some newspapers \\nprinted stories involving him with S0II0220. They published \\nproof that McQuskey had received large sums of money in \\ncash, shortly before His death. These stories had been planted \\nby Hagen, the information supplied by him. The Police De- \\npartment refused to confirm or deny these stories, but they \\n\\n\\n\\nwere taking effect. The police force got the word through \\ninformers, through police on the Family payroll, that Me- \\nQuskey had been a rogue cop. Not that he had taken money \\nor clean graft, there was no rank-and-file onus to that. But that he \\nhad taken the dirtiest of dirty money; murder and drugs money. \\nAnd in the morality of policemen, this was unforgivable. \\n\\nHagen understood that the policeman belie^^es in law and \\norder in a curiously innocent way. He believed in it more than \\ndoes the public he serves. Law and order is, after all, the magic \\nfrom which he derives his power, individual power which he \\ncherishes as nearly all men cherish individual power. And yet \\nthere is always the smouldering resentment against the public \\nhe serves. They are at the same time his ward and his prey. As \\nwards they are ungrateful, abusive and demanding. As prey \\nthey are slippery and dangerous, full of guile. As soon as one \\nis in the policeman’s clutches the mechanism of the society the \\npoliceman defends marshals all its resources to cheat him of his \\nprize. The fix is put in by politicians. Judges give lenient sus- \\npended sentences to the worst hoodlums. Governors of the \\nStates and the President of the United States himself give full \\npardons, assuming that respected lawyers have not already \\nwon his acquittal. After a time the cop learns. Why should he \\nnot collect the fees these hoodlums are paying? He needs it \\nmore. His children, why should they not go to college? Why \\nshouldn’t his wife shop in more expensive places? Why \\nshouldn’t he himself get the sun with a winter vacation in \\nFlorida? After all, he risks his life and that is no joke. \\n\\nBut usually he draws the line against accepting dirty graft. \\nHe will take money to let a bookmaker operate. He will take \\nmopey from a man who hates getting parking tickets or speed- \\ning tickets. He will allow call girls and prostitutes to ply their \\ntrade; for a consideration. These are vices natural to man. But \\nusually he will not take a payoff for drugs, armed robberies, \\nrape, murder and other assorted perversions. In his mind these \\nattack the very core of his personal authority and cannot be \\ncountenanced. \\n\\nThe murder of a police captain was comparable to regicide. \\nBut when it became known that McCluskcy had been killed \\nwhile in the company of a notorious narcotics peddler, when it \\n\\n\\n\\nbecame known that he was suspected of conspiracy to murder, \\nthe police desire for vengeance began to fade. Also, after all, \\nthere were still mortgage payments to be made, cars to be paid \\noff, children to be launched into the world. Without their \\n\\' sheet ^ money, policemen had to scramble to make ends meet. \\nUnlicenccd peddlers were good for lunch money. Parking \\nticket payoffs came to nickels and dimes. Some of the more \\ndesperate even began shaking down suspects (homoseicuals, \\nassaults and batteries) in the precinct squad rooms. Finally the \\nbrass relented. They raised the prices and let the Faroes \\noperate. Once again the payoff sheet was typed up by the \\nprecinct bagman, listing every man assigned to the local \\nstation and what his cut was each month. Some semblance of \\nsocial order was restored. \\n\\nIt had been Hagen*s idea to use private detectives to guard \\nDon Corleone’s hospital room. These were, of course, supple- \\nmented by the much more formidable soldiers of Tessio’s \\nre^\\'me. But Sonny was not satisfied ev\\'en with this. By the \\nmiddle of February, when the Don could be moved without \\ndanger, be was taken by ambulance to his home in the mall. \\nThe house had been renovated so that his bedroom was now \\na hospital room with all equipment necessary for any emer- \\ngency, Nurses specially recruited and checked had been hired \\nfor round-the-clock care, and Dr Kennedy, with the payment \\nof a huge fee, bad been persuaded to become the physician in \\nresidence to this private hospital. At least until the Don would \\nneed only nursing care. \\n\\nThe mall itself was made impregnable. Button men were \\nmoved into the extra houses, the tenants sent on vacations to \\ntheir native villages in Italy, all expenses paid. \\n\\nFreddie Corleone had been sent to Las Vegas to recuperate \\nand also to scout out the ground for a Family operation in the \\nluxury hotel-gambling casino complex that was springing up. \\nLas Vegas was part of the West Coast empire still neutral and \\nthe Don of that empire had guaranteed Freddie’s safety there. \\nThe New York five Families had no desire to make more \\nenemies by going into Vegas after Freddie Corleone. They had \\nenough trouble on their hands in New York. \\n\\n\\n*55 \\n\\n\\n\\nDr Kennedy had forbidden any discussion of business in front \\nof the Don. This edict was completely disregarded. The Don \\ninsisted on the council of war being held in his room. Sonny, \\nTom Hagen, Pete Qemen2a, and Tessio gathered there the very \\nfirst night of his homecoming. \\n\\nDon Corlcone was too weak to speak much but he wished to \\nlisten and exercise veto powers. Vdien it was explained that \\nFreddie had been sent to Las Vegas to learn the gambling \\n.casino business, he nodded his head approvingly. When he \\nlearned that Bruno Tattaglia had been killed by Corleone \\nbutton men he shook his head and sighed. But what distressed \\nhim most of all was learning that Michael had killed Sollozzo \\nand Captain McCluskey and had then been forced to flee to \\nSicily. When he heard this he motioned them out and they \\ncontinued the conference in the corner room that held the law \\nlibrary. \\n\\nSonny Corleone relaxed in the huge armchair behind the \\ndesk. \\'I think we’d better let the old man take it easy for a \\ncouple of weeks, until the doc says he can do business.’ He \\npaused. ‘I’d like to have it going again before he gets better. \\nWe have the go-ahead from the cops to operate. The first \\nthing is the policy banks in Harlem. The black boys up there \\nhad their fun, now we have to take it back. They screwed up \\nthe works but good, just like they usually do when they run \\nthings. A lot of their runners didn’t pay off winners. They drive \\nup in Cadillacs and tell their players they gotta wait for their \\ndough or maybe just pay them half what they win. I don’t want \\nany runner looking rich to his players. I don’t want them \\ndressing too good. I don’t want them driving new cars. I don’t \\nwant them welching on paying a winner. And I don’t \\nwant any freelancers staying in business, they give us a bad \\nname. Tom, let’s get that project moving right away. Every- \\nthing else will fall in line as soon as you send out the word that \\nthe lid is off.’ \\n\\nHagen said, ‘ There are some very tough boys up in Harlem. \\nThey got a taste of the big money. They won’t go back to be- \\ning runners or sub-bankers again.* \\n\\nSonny shrugged. ‘Just give their names to Qemenza. That’s \\nhis job, straightening them out.’ \\n\\n\\n*54 \\n\\n\\n\\nQemenza said to Hagen, *No problem.’ \\n\\nIt was Tessio who brought up the most important question. \\n‘Once we start operating, the five Families start their raids. \\nThey’ll hit our bankers in Harlem and our bookmakers on the \\nEast Side. They may even try to make things tough for the \\ngarment centre outfits we service. This war is going to cost a \\nlot of money.’ \\n\\n‘Maybe they won’t,’ Sonny said. ‘They know we’ll hit them \\nright back. I’ve got peace feelers out and maybe we can settle \\neverything by paying an indemnity for the Tattaglia kid.’ \\n\\nHagen said, ‘We’re getting the cold shoulder on those \\nnegotiations. They lost a lot of dough the last few months and \\nthey blame us for it. With justice. I think what they want is for \\nus to agree to come in on the narcotics trade, to use the Family \\ninfluence politically. In other words, Sollo22o’5 deal minus \\nSoUozzo. But they won’t broach that until they’ve hurt us with \\nsome sort of combat action. Then after we’ve been softened up \\nthey figure we’ll listen to a proposition on narcotics.’ \\n\\nSonny said curtly, ‘No d^ on drugs. The Don said no and \\nit’s no until he changes it.’ \\n\\nHagen said briskly, ‘Then we’re faced with a tactical prob- \\nlem. Our money is out in the open. Bookmaking and policy. \\nWe can be hit. But the Tattaglia Family has prostitution and \\ncall girls and the dock unions. How the hell are we going to \\nhit them? The other Families are in some gambling. But most \\nof them are in the construction trades, shylocking, controlling \\nthe unions, getting the government contracts. They get a lot \\nfrom strong-arm and other stuff that involves innocent people. \\nThek money isn’t out in the street. The Tattaglia nightclub is \\ntoo famous to touch, it would cause too much of a stink. And \\nwith the Don still out of action their political influence matches \\nours. So we’ve got a real problem here.’ \\n\\n‘It’s my problem, Tom,’ Sonny said. ‘I’ll find the answer. \\nKeep the negotiation alive and follow through on the other \\nstuff. Let’s go back into business and see what happens. Then \\nwe’ll take it from there. Qemenza and Tessio have plenty of \\nsoldiers, we can match the whole Five Families gun for gun \\nif that’s the way they want it. We’ll just go to the mattresses.’ \\n\\nThere was no problem getting the freelance Negro bankers \\n\\n\\n^55 \\n\\n\\n\\nout of business. The police were informed and cracked down. \\nWith a special effort. At that time it was not possible for a \\nNegro to make a payoff to a high police or political official to \\nkeep such an operation going. This was due to racial prejudice \\nand racial distrust more than anything else. But Harlem had \\nalways been considered a minor problem, and its settlement \\nwas expected. \\n\\nThe Five Families struck in an unexpected direction. Two \\npowerful officials in the garment unions were killed, officials \\nwho were members of the Corleone Family. Then the Corlcone \\nFamily shylocks were barred from the waterfront pic ns were \\nthe Corleone Family bookmakers. The longshore^ or \\'?: uajon \\nlocals had gone over to the Five Families. Corleone book- \\nmakers all over the city were threatened to persuade them to \\nchange their allegiance. The biggest numbers banker in Hailcm, \\nan old friend and ally of the Corleone Family, brutally \\nmurdered. Tliere was no longer ahy option, bonny fold his \\ncaporepmes to go to the mattresses. \\n\\nTwo apartments were set up in the city and furnished with \\nmattresses for the button men to sleep on, a rcfrigcratoi: for \\nfood, and guns and ammunition. Qcmenxa staffed one apatt- \\nmeot and Tessio the other. All Family bookmakers were given \\nbodyguard teams. The policy bankers in Harlem, however, \\nhad gone over to the enemy and at the moment nothing could \\nbe done about that. All this cost the Corleone Family a great \\ndeal of money and very little was coming in. As the next few \\nmonths went by, other things became obvious. The most im- \\nportant was that the Corleone Family had overmatched itself. \\n\\nThere were reasons for this. With the Don still too weak to \\ntake a part, a great deal of the Family’s political strength was \\nncufralixed. Also, the last ten years of peace had seriously \\neroded the fighting qualities of the two caporeffmes^ Clemenza \\nand Tessio. Clemenza was still a competent executioner and \\nadministrator but he no longer had the energy or the youthful \\nstrength to lead troops. Tessio had mellowed with age and was \\nnot ruthless enough. Tom Hagen, despite his abilities, was \\nsimply not suited to be a Consi^ori in a time of war. His main \\nfiiult was that be was not a Sicilian. \\n\\nSonny Corleone recognized these weaknesses in the Family’s \\n\\n256 \\n\\n\\n\\nwtniinc postutc but could not take any steps to temedy diem. \\nHe iFas not the Don and only the Don could xeplaoe the \\ncapertffmes and the C&nsigliori. And the very act of replaoemefit \\n•would make the situation more dangerous, might precipitate \\nsome treachery. At first. Sonny had thought of fighting a hold- \\ning action until the Don could become well enough to take \\ncharge, but with the defection of the policy bankers, the ter- \\nroriaation of the bookmakers, the Family position was becom- \\ning precarious. He decided to strike back. \\n\\nBut he decided to strike right at the heart of the enemy. He \\nplamied the execution of the heads of the five Families in one \\ngrand tactical manoeuvre. To that purpose he put into efiect an \\nelaborate system of surveillance of these leasts. But after a \\nweek the enemy chiefs promptly dived underground and were \\nseen no more in public. \\n\\nThe Five Fam^es and the Corleone Empire were in stide- \\nmate. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN \\n\\nAmerigo Bonasera lived only a few blocks from his \\nundertaking establishment on Mul^rry Street and so always \\nwent home for supper. Evenings he returned to his place of \\nbusiness, dutifully joining those mourners paying their res- \\npects to the dead who lay in state in his sombre parlours. \\n\\nHe always resented the jokes made about his profession, die \\nmacabre technical details which were so unimportant. Of \\ncourse none of his friends or family or neighbours would make \\nsuch jokes. Any profession was worthy of respect to men who \\nfor centuries earned bread by the sweat of their brows. \\n\\nNow at supper with his wife in their solidly furnished apart- \\nment, gilt statues of the Virgin Mary with their red-glassed \\ncandles flickering on the sideboard, Bonasera lit a Camd \\ndgarette and took a relaxing glass of American whisky. Hit \\nwife brought steaming plates s^up to the table. The two of \\nthem were alone now; he had sdit his daughter to live in \\n\\n*57 \\n\\n\\n, Godfather \\n\\n\\n\\nBoston with her mothcr^s sister, where she could forget her \\nterrible experience and her injuries at the hands of the two \\nruffians Don Q>rleone had punished. \\n\\nAs they ate their soup his wife asked, ‘Are you going back \\nto work tonight?’ \\n\\nAmerigo Bonasera nodded. His wife respected his work but \\ndid not understand it. She did not understand that the tech* \\nnical part of his profession was the least important. She \\nthought, like most other people, that he was paid for his skill \\nin making the dead look so lifelike in their coffins. And indeed \\nhis skill in this was legendary. But even more important, even \\nmore necessary was his physical presence at the wake. When \\nthe bereaved family came at night to receive their blood rela- \\ntives and their friends beside the coffin of their loved one, they \\nneeded Amerigo Bonasera with them. \\n\\nFor he was a strict chaperone to death. His face always grave, \\nyet strong and comforting, his voice unwavering, yet muted \\nto a low register, he commanded the mourning ritual. He \\ncould quiet grief that was too unseemly, he could rebuke un- \\nruly children whose parents had not the heart to chastise. \\nNever cloying in the tender of his condolences, yet never was \\nhe offhand. Once a family used Amerigo Bonasera to speed a \\nloved one on, they came back to him again and again. And he \\nnever, never, deserted one of his clients on that terrible last \\nnight above ground. \\n\\nUsually he allowed himself a little nap after supper. Then he \\nwashed and shaved afresh, talcum powder generously used to \\nshroud the heavy black beard. A mouthwash always. He re- \\nspectfully changed into fresh linen, white gleaming shirt, the \\nblack tie, a freshly pressed dark suit, dull black shoes and black \\nsocks. And yet the effect was comforting instead of sombre. \\nHe also kept his hair dyed black, an unheard-of frivolity in an \\nItalian male of his generation; but not out of vanity. Simply \\nbecause his hair had turned a lively pepper and salt, a colour \\nwhich struck him as -unseemly for his profession. \\n\\nAfter he finished his soup, his wife placed a small steak be- \\nfore him with a few forkfuls of green spinach oozing yellow \\noil. He was a light cater. When he finished this he drank a cup \\nof coffee and smoked another Camel cigarette. Over his coffee \\n\\n25 B \\n\\n\\n\\nhe thought about his poor daughter. She would never be the \\nsame. Her outward beauty had been restored but there was die \\nlook of a frightened animal in her eyes that had made him \\nunable to bear the sight of her. And so they had sent her to \\nlive in Boston for a time. Time would heal her wounds. Pain \\nand terror were not so final as deaths as he well knew. His work \\nmade him an optimist. \\n\\nHe had just finished the coffee when his phone in the living \\nroom rang. His wife never answered it when he was home, so \\nhe got up and drained his cup and stubbed out his cigarette. \\nAs he walked to the phone he pulled ofT his tie and started \\nto unbutton his shirt, getting ready for his little nap. Then \\nhe picked up the phone and said with quiet courtesy, \\n‘HcUo.* \\n\\nThe voice on the other end was harsh, strained. *This is \\nTom Hagen,’ it said. ^I’m calling for Don Corleone, at his \\nrequest.’ \\n\\nAmerigo Bonasera felt the coffix churning sourly in his \\nstomach, felt himself going a httle sick. It was more than a \\nyear since he had put himself in the debt of the Don to avenge \\nhis daughter’s honour and in that time the knowledge that he \\nmust pay that debt had receded. He had been so grated seeing \\nthe bloc^y faces of those two ruffians that he would have done \\nanything for the Don. But time erodes gratitude more quickly \\nthan it does beauty. Now Bonasera felt the sickness of a man \\nfaced with disaster. His voice faltered as he answered, * Yes, I \\nunderstand. I’m listening.’ \\n\\nHe was suiprised at the coldness in Hagen’s voice. The Cm- \\nngliori had always been a courteous man, though not Italian, \\nbut now he was being rudely brusque. *You owe the Don a \\nservice,’ Hagen said. * He has no doubt, that you will repay him. \\nThat you will be happy to have this opportunity. In one hour, \\nnot b^ore, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlour to \\nask for your help. Be there to greet him. Don’t have any people \\nwho work for you there. Send them home. If you have any \\nobjections to this, speak now and I’ll inform Don Corleone. \\nHe has other friends who can do him this service.’ \\n\\nAmerigo Bonasera almost cried out in his fright, *How can \\nyou think I would refuse the Godfather? Of course I’ll do \\n\\n\\n\\nanything he wishes. I haven’t forgotten my debt. I’ll go to my \\nbusiness immediately, at once.* \\n\\nHagen’s voice was gentler now, but there was something \\nstrange about it. ‘Thank you,* he said. ‘The Don never \\ndoubted you. The question was mine. Oblige him tonight and \\nyou can always come to me in any trouble, you’ll earn my \\npersonal friendship.’ \\n\\nThis frightened Amerigo Bonasera even more. He stuttered, \\n*The Don himself is coming to me tonight?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,* Hagen said. \\n\\n‘Then he’s completely recovered from his injuries, thank \\nGod,’ Bonasera said. His voice made it a question. \\n\\nThere was a pause at the other end of the phone, then \\nHagen’s voice said very quietly, ‘Yes.’ There was a click and \\nthe phone went dead. \\n\\nBonasera was sweating. He went into the bedroom and \\nchanged his shirt and rinsed his mouth. But he didn’t shave or \\nuse a fresh tie. He put on the same one he had used during the \\nday. He called the hineral parlour and told his assistant to stay \\nwith the bereaved family using the front parlour that night. He \\nhimself would be busy in the laboratory working area of the \\nbuilding. When the assistant started asking questions Bonasera \\ncut him off very curtly and told him to follow orders exactly. \\n\\nHe put on his suit jacket and his wife, still eating, looked up \\nat him in surprise. ‘I have work to do,’ he said and she did not \\ndare question him because of the look on his face. Bonasera \\nwent out of the house and walked the few blocks to his funeral \\nparlour. \\n\\nThis building stood by itself on a large lot with a white \\npicket fence running all around it. There was a narrow road- \\nway leading from the street to the rear, just wide enough for \\nambulances and hearses. Bonasera unlocked the gate and left \\nit open. Then he walked to the rear of the building and entered \\nit through the wide door there. As he did so he could see \\nmourners already entering the front door of the funeral parlour \\nto pay their respects to the current corpse. \\n\\nMany years ago when Bonasera had bought this building \\nfrom an undertaker planning to retire, there had been a stoop \\nof about ten steps that mourners had to mount before entering \\n\\n160 \\n\\n\\n\\nthe fiiiiend parlour. This had posed a pipblem. Old and \\npled mourners determined to pay tfaeit respects had found the \\nsteps almost impossible to mount, so the former undertaker \\nhad used the freight elevator for these people, a small metal \\nplatform, that rose out of the ground beside the building. The \\nelevator was for cofHns and bodies. It would descend under- \\nground, then rise into the funeral parlour itself, so that a \\ncrippled mourner would find himself rising through the floor \\nbeside the coffin as other mourners moved their black chairs \\naside to let the elevator rise through the trapdoor. Then when \\nthe crippled or aged mourner had finished paying his respects,, \\nthe elevator wcidd again come up through the polished floor \\nto take him down and out again. \\n\\nAmerigo Booasera had found this solution to the problem \\nunseemly and penny-pinching. So he had had the front of the \\nbuilding remodelled, the stoop done away with and a slightly \\ninclining walk put in its place. But of course the elevator was \\nstill used for coffins and corpses. \\n\\nIn the rear of the building, cut off from the funeral parlour \\nand reception rooms by a massive soundproof door, was the \\nbusiness office, the embalming room, a storeroom for coffins, \\nand a carefully locked closet holding chemicals and the awful \\ntools of his trade. Bonasera went to the office, sat at his desk \\nand lit up a Camel, one of the few times he had ever smoked \\nin this building. Then he waited for Don Corleone. \\n\\nHe waited with a feeling of the utmost despair. For he had \\nno doubt as to what services he would be called upon to per- \\nform. For the last year the Corleone Family had waged war \\nagainst the five great Mafia Families of New York and the \\ncarnage had filled the newspapers. Many men qn both sides \\nhad been killed. Now the Corleone Family had killed some- \\nbody so important that they wished to hide his body, make it \\ndisappear, and what better way than to have it officially buried \\nby a registered undertaker? And Amerigo Bonasera had no \\nillusions about the act he was to commit. He would be an \\naccessory to murder. If it came out, he would spend years in \\njaiL His daughter and wife would be disgraced, his good name, \\nthe respected name of Amerigo Bonasera, dragged through \\nthe blo^y mud of the Mafia war. \\n\\n261 \\n\\n\\n\\nHe indulged himself hy smoking another Camel. And then \\nhe thought of something even more terrifying. When the other \\nMafia Families found out that he had aided the Corleones they \\nwould treat him as an ei^my. They would murder him. And \\nnow he cursed the day he had gone to the Godfather and beg- \\nged for his vengeance. He cursed the day his wife and the wife \\nof Don Corleone had become friends, fie cursed his daughter \\nand America and his own success. And then his optimism \\nreturned. It could all go well. Don Corleone was a clever man. \\nCertainly everything had been arranged to keep the secret. He \\nhad only to keep his nerve. For of course the one thing more \\nfatal than any other was\\' to earn the Don’s displeasure. \\n\\nHe heard tyres on gravel. His practised ear told him a car \\nwas coming dirough the narrow driveway and parking in the \\nback yard. He opened the rear door to let them in. The huge \\nfat man, Clemen2a, entered, followed by two very rough- \\nlooking young fellows. They searched the rooms without say- \\ning a word to Bonasera, then Clemenza went out. The two \\nyoung men remained with the undertaker. \\n\\nA few moments later Bonasera recognized the sound of a \\nheavy ambulance coming through the narrow driveway. Then \\nQemenza appeared in the doorway followed by two men \\ncarrying a stretcher. And Amerigo Bonascra’s worst fears \\nwere realized. On the stretcher was a corpse swaddled in a \\ngrey blanket but with bare yellow feet sticking out the end. \\n\\nQemenza motioned the stretcher-bearers into the embalm- \\ning room. And then from the blackness of the yard another \\nman stepped into the lighted office room. It was Don Corleone. \\n\\nThe Don had lost weight during his illness and moved with \\na curious stiffness. He was holding his hat in his hands and his \\nhair seamed thin over his massive skull. He looked older, more \\nshrunken than when Bonasera had seen him at the wedding, \\nbut he still radiated power. Holding his hat against his chest, \\nhe said to Bonasera, ‘ Well, old friend, are you ready to do me \\nthis service?’ \\n\\nBonasera nodded. The Don followed the stretcher into the \\nembalming room and Bonasera trailed after him. The corpse \\nwas on one of the guttered tables. Don Corleone made a tiny \\ngesture with his hat and the other men left the room. \\n\\n262 \\n\\n\\n\\nBonaseta whispered, ‘What do you wish me to do?* \\n\\nDon Corleone was staring at the table. ‘I want you to use all \\nyour powers, all your skill, as you love me,’ he said. ‘Irlo not \\nwish his mother to see him as he is.’ He went to the table and \\ndrew down the grey blanket. Amerigo Bonasera against all his \\nwill, against all his years of training and experience, let out a \\ngasp of horror. On the embalming table was the bullet- \\nsmashed face of Sonny Corleone. The left eye drowned in \\nblood had a star fracture in its lens. The bridge of his nose and \\nleft cheekbone were hammered into pulp. \\n\\nFor one fraction of a second the Don put out his hand to \\nsupport himself against Bonasera’s body. ‘ See how they have \\nmassacred my son,’ he said. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINETEEN \\n\\nPerhaps it was the stalemate that made Sonny Corleone \\nembark on the bloody course of attrition that ended in his own \\ndeath. Perhaps it was his dark violent nature given full rein. \\nIn any case, that spring and summer he mounted senseless raids \\non enemy auxiliaries. Tattaglia Family pimps were shot to death \\nin Harlem, dock goons were massacred. Union officials who \\nowed allegiance to the Five Families were warned to stay \\nneutral, and when the Corleone bookmakers and shy locks \\nwere still barred from the docks. Sonny sent Qemenza and his \\nregime to wreak havoc upon the long shore. \\n\\nThis slaughter was senseless because it could ndt affect the \\noutcome of the war. Sonny was a brilliant tactician and won \\nhis brilliant victories. But what was needed was the strategical \\ngenius of Don Corleone. The whole thing degenerated into \\nsuch a deadly guerrilla war that both sides found themselves \\nlosing a great deal of revenue and lives to no purpose. The \\nCorleone Family was finally forced to dose down some of its \\nmost profitable bookmaking stations, including the book given \\nto son-in-law Carlo Rizsd for his living. Carlo took to drink and \\nrunning with chorus girls and giving his wife Connie a hard \\n\\n263 \\n\\n\\n\\ntune. Since his beating at the hands of Sonny he had not dared \\nto hit his wife again but he had not slept with her. Connie bad \\nthrown herself at his feet and he had spumed her, as he thought, \\nlike a Roman, with exquisite patrician pleasure. He had sneered \\nat her, *Go call your brother and tell him I won^t screw you, \\nmaybe he’ll beat me up until I get a hard on.’ \\n\\nBut he was in deadly fear of Sonny though they treated each \\nother with cold politeness. Carlo had the sense to realize that \\nSonny would kill him, that Sonny was a man who could, with \\nthe naturalness of an animal, kill another man, while he him- \\nself would have to call up all his courage, all his wiD, to com- \\nmit murder. It never occurred to Carlo that because of this he \\nwas a better man than Sonny Corleone, if such terms could be \\nused; he envied Sonny his awesome savagery, a savagery which \\nwas now becoming a legend. \\n\\nTom Hagen, as the Consigliori^ disapproved of Sonny’s tac- \\ntics and yet decided not to protest to the Don simply because \\nthe tactics, to some extent, worked. The Five Families seemed \\nto be cowed, finally, as the attrition went on, and their \\ncounterblows weakened and finally ceased altogether. Hagen \\nat first distrusted this seeming pacification of the enemy but \\nSonny was jubilant. ‘I’ll pour it on,’ he told Hagen, ‘and then \\nthose bastards will come begging for a deal.’ \\n\\nSonny was worried about other things. His wife was giving \\nhim a hard time because the rumours had got to her that \\nLucy Mancini had bewitched her husband. And though she \\njoked publicly about her Sonny’s equipment and technique, he \\nhad stayed awayfrom hertoolongand she missed himinherbed, \\nand she was making life miserable for him with her nagging. \\n\\nIn, addition to this Sonny was under the enormous strain of \\nbeing a marked man. He had to be extraordinarily careful in all \\nhis movements and he knew that his visits to Lucy Mancini \\nhad been charted by the enemy. But here he took elaborate \\nprecautions since this was the traditional vulnerable spot. He \\nwas safe there. Though Lucy had not the slightest suspicion, \\nshe was watched twenty-four hours a day by men of the San- \\ntino regime and when an apartment became vacant on her floor \\nit was immediately rented by one of the most reliable men of \\nthat regime. \\n\\n\\n264 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Don was tecoTering and would soon be aUe to tesume \\ncommand. At that time the tide of battle must swing to the \\nCorleone Family. This Sonny was sure of. Meanwhile he would \\nguard his Family’s empire^ earn the respect of his father, and, \\nsince the position was not hereditary to an absolute degree, \\ncement his claim as heir to the Corleone Empire. \\n\\nBut the enemy was making its plans. They too had analysed \\nthe situation and had come to the conclusion that the only way \\nto stave off complete defeat was to kill Sonny Corleone. They \\nunderstood the situation better now and felt it was possible to \\nnegotiate with the Don, known for his logical reasonableness. \\nThey had come to hate Sonny for his bloodthirstiness, which \\nthey considered barbaric. Also not good business sense. No- \\nbody wanted the old days back again with all its turmoil and \\ntrouble. \\n\\nOne evening Connie Corleone received an anonymous phone \\ncall, a girl’s voice, asking for Carlo. \"Who is this?’ Connie \\nasked. \\n\\nThe girl on the other end giggled and said, ‘Fm a friend of \\nCarlo’s. I just wanted to tell him I can’t sec him tonight. I have \\nto go out of town.’ \\n\\n^You lousy bitch,* Connie Corleone said. She screamed it \\nagain into the phone. ‘You lousy tramp bitch.’ There was a \\nclick on the other end. \\n\\nCarlo had gone to the track for that afternoon and when he \\ncame home in the late evening he was sore at losing and half \\ndrunk from the bottle he always carried. As soon as he stepped \\ninto the door, Connie started screaming curses at him. He \\nignored her and went in to take a shower. When he came out \\nhe dried his naked body in front of her and started dolling up \\nto go out. \\n\\nConnie stood with hands on hips, her face pointy and white \\nwith rage. ‘You’re not going any place,’ she said. ‘Your girl- \\nfriend called and said she can’t make it tonight. You lousy \\nbastard, you have the nerve to give your whores my phone \\nnumber. I’ll kill you, you bastard.’ She rushed at him, kicking \\nand scratching. \\n\\nHe held her oflf with one muscular forearm. ‘ You’re crazy,\\' \\nhe said coldly. But she could see he was worried, as if he knew \\n\\n*65 \\n\\n\\n\\nthe or azy girl he was screwing would actually pull such a stunt. \\n*She was kidding around, some nut/ Carlo said. \\n\\nConnie ducked around his arm and clawed at his face. She \\ngot a little bit of his cheek under her fingernails. With sur- \\nprising patience he pushed her away. She noticed he was careful \\nbecause of her pregnancy and that gave her the courage to feed \\nher rage. She was also excited. Pretty soon she wouldn’t be \\nable to do anything, the doctor had said no sex for the last two \\nmonths and she wanted it, before the last two months started. \\nYet her wish to inflict a physical injilry on Carlo was very real \\ntoo. She followed him into the bedroom. \\n\\nShe could see he was scared and that filled her with con- \\ntemptuous delight. ‘You’re staying home,’ she said, ‘you’re \\nnot going out.’ \\n\\n‘OK, OK,’ he said. He was still undressed, only wearing \\nhis shorts. He liked to go around the house like that, he was \\nproud of his V-shaped body, the golden skin. Connie looked \\nat him hungrily. He tried to laugh. ‘You gonna give me some- \\nthing to eat at least?’ \\n\\nThat mollified her, his calling on her duties, one of them \\nat least. She was a good cook, she had learned that from \\nher mother. She sauteed veal and peppers, preparing a mixed \\nsalad while the pan simmered. Meanwhile Carlo stretched \\nout on his bed to read the next day’s racing form. He had a \\nwater glass full of whisky beside him which he kept sipping \\nat. \\n\\nConnie came into the bedroom. She stood in the doorway as \\nif she could not come close to the bed without being invited. \\n‘The food is on the table,’ she said. \\n\\n‘I’m not hungry yet,’ he said, still reading the racing form. \\n\\n‘It’s on the table,’ Connie said stubbornly. \\n\\n‘Stick it up your ass/ Carlo said. He drank off the rest of the \\nwhisky in the water glass, tilted the bottle to fill it again. He \\npaid no more attention to her. \\n\\nConnie went into the kitchen, picked up the plates filled with \\nfood and smashed them against the sink. The loud crashes \\nbrought Carlo in from the bedroom. He looked at the greasy \\nveal and peppers splattered all over the kitchen walls and his \\nfinicky neatness was outraged. ‘You filthy guinea spoiled brat,’ \\n\\n266 \\n\\n\\n\\nhe said venomously. ‘Qean that up right now or Pll kick the \\nshit out of you/ \\n\\n\\'Like hell I will/ Connie said. She held her hands like claws \\nready to scratch his bare chest to ribbons. \\n\\nCarlo went back into the bedroom and when he came out he \\nwas holding his belt doubled in his hand. ‘ Qean it up/ he said \\nand there was no mistaking the menace in his voice. She stood \\nthere not moving and he swung the belt against her heavily \\npadded hips, the leather stinging but not really hurting. Con- \\nnie retreated to tlie kitchen cabinets and her hand went into \\none of the drawers to haul out the long bread knife. She held \\nit ready. \\n\\nCarlo laughed. * Even the female Corleones are murderers/ \\nhe said. He put the belt down on the kitchen table and ad- \\nvanced towards her. She tried a sudden lunge but her pregnant \\nheavy body made her slow and he eluded the thrust she aimed \\nat his groin in such deadly earnest. He disarmed her easily and \\nthen he started to slap her face with a slow medium-heavy \\nstroke so as not to break the skin. He hit her again and again \\nas she retreated around the kitchen table trying to escape him \\nand he pursued her into the bedroom. She tried to bite his hand \\nand he grabbed her by the hair to lift her head up. He slapped \\nher face until she began to weep like a little girl, with pain and \\nhumiliation. Then he threw her contemptuously on to the bed. \\nHe drank from the bottle of whisky still on the night table. He \\nseemed very drunk now, his light blue eyes had a crazy glint in \\nthem and finally Connie was truly afraid. \\n\\nCarlo straddled his legs apart and drank from the bottle. He \\nreached down and grabbed a chunk of her pregnapt heavy \\nthigh in his hand. He squeezed very hard, hurting her and mak- \\ning her beg for mercy. ‘ You^rc fat as a pig,\\' he said with dis- \\ngust and walked out of the bedroom. \\n\\nThoroughly frightened and cowed, she lay on the bed, not \\ndaring to see what her husband was doing in the other room. \\nFinally she rose and went to the door to peer into the living \\nroom. Carlo had opened a fresh bottle of whisky and was \\nsprawled on the sofa. In a little while he would drink himself \\ninto sodden sleep and she could sneak into the kitchen and call \\nher family in Long Beach. She would tell her mother to send \\n\\n267 \\n\\n\\n\\nsomeone out here to get her. She just hoped Sonny didn’t \\nanswer the phone, she knew it would be best to talk to Tom \\nHagen or her mother. \\n\\nIt was nearly ten o’clock at night when the kitchen phone in \\nDon Corleone’s house rang. It was answered by one of the \\nDon’s bodyguards who dutifully turned the phone over to \\nConnie’s mother. But Mrs Corleonc could hardly understand \\nwhat her daughter was saying, the girl was hysterical yet trying \\nto whisper so that her husband in the next room would not \\nhear her. Also her face had become swollen because of the \\nslaps, and her puffy lips thickened her speech. Mrs Corleone \\nmade a sign to the bodyguard that he should call Sonny, who \\nwas in the living room with Tom Hagen, \\n\\nSonny came into the kitchen and took the phone from his \\nmother. ‘Yeah, Connie,’ he said. \\n\\nConnie was so frightened hoth of her husband and of what \\nher brother would do that her sf eech became worse. She bab- \\nbled, ‘Sonny, just send a car to bring me home. I’ll tell you \\nthen, it’s nothing. Sonny. Don’t you come. Send Tom, please, \\nSonny. It’s nothing. I just want to come home.’ \\n\\nBy this time Hagen had come into the room. The Don was \\nalready under a sedated sleep in the bedroom above and Hagen \\nwanted to keep an eye on Sonny in all crises. The two interior \\nbodyguards were also in the kitchen. Everybody was watching \\nSonny as he listened on the phone. \\n\\nThere was no question that the violence in Sonny Corleone’s \\nnature rose from some deep mysterious physical Well. As they \\nwatched they could actually see the blood rushing to his heavily \\ncorded neck, could sec the eyes film with hatred, the separate \\nfeatures of his face tightening, growing pinched, then his £ice \\ntook on the greyish hue of a sick man fighting o& some sort \\nof death, except that the adrenaline pumping through his body \\nmade his hands tremble. But his voice was controlled, pitched \\nlow, as he told his sister, ‘You wait there. You just wait there.’ \\nHe hung up the phone. \\n\\nHe stood there for a moment quite stunned with his pwn \\nrage, then he said, ‘The fucking sonofabitch, jthe fucking soo- \\nofabitch.’ He ran out of the house, \\n\\nHagen knew the look on Sonny’s face, all reasoning power \\n\\n268 \\n\\n\\n\\nhad left him. At this moment Sonny was capable of anything. \\nHagen also knew that the ride into the city would cool Sonny \\noff, make him more rational. But that rationality might make \\nhim even more dangerous, though the rationality would en- \\nable him to protect himself against the consequences of his \\nrage. Hagen heard the car motor roaring into life and he said \\nto the two bodyguards, ‘Go after him.* \\n\\nThen he went to the phone and made some calls. He ar- \\nranged for some men of Sonny*s reffme living in the city to go \\nup to Carlo Rizzi’s apartment and get Carlo out of there. Other \\nmen would stay with Connie until Sonny arrived. He was tak- \\ning a chance, thwarting Sonny, but he knew the Don would \\nback him up. He was afraid that Sonny might kill Carlo in \\nftont of witnesses. He did not expect trouble ftom the enemy. \\nThe Five Families had been quiet too long and obviously were \\nlooking for peace of some kind. \\n\\nBy the time Sonny roared out of the mall in his Buick,* he \\nhad already regained, partly, his senses. He noted the two bc^y- \\nguatds getting into a car to follow him and approved. He ex- \\npected no danger, the Five Families had quit counterattacking, \\nwere not really fighting any more. He had grabbed his jacket \\nin the foyer and there was a gun in a secret dashboard com- \\npartment of the car, the car registered in the name of a member \\nhis regime^ so that he personally could not get into any legal \\ntrouble. But he did not anticipate needing any weapon. He did \\nnot even know what he was going to do with Carlo Rizzi. \\n\\nNow that he had a chance to think. Sonny knew he could \\nnot kill the father of an unborn child, and that father his sister’s \\nhusband. Not over a domestic spat. Except that it <iot just \\na domestic spat. Carlo was a bad guy and Sonny felt responsible \\nthat his sister had met the bastard through him. \\n\\nThe paradox in Sonny’s violent nature was that he could not \\nhit a woman and had never done so. That he could not harm \\na child or anything helpless. When Carlo had refused to fight \\nback against him that cky, it had kept Sonny from killing him^ \\ncomplete submission disarmed his violence. As a boy, he had \\nbeen truly tenderhearted. That he had become a murderer as a \\nman was simply his destiny. \\n\\nBut he would settle this thing once and for all. Sonny \\n\\n\\n\\nthought, as he headed the Buick towards the causeway that \\nwould take him over the water from Long Beach to the park- \\nways on the other side of Jones Beach. He always used this \\nroute when he went to New York. There was less traHic. \\n\\nHe decided he would send Connie home with the body- \\nguards and then he would have a session with his brother-in- \\nlaw. What would happen after that he didn’t know. If the \\nbastard had really hurt Connie, he’d make a cripple out of the \\nbastard. But the wind coming over the causeway, the salty \\nfreshness of the air, cooled his anger. He put the window down \\nall the way. \\n\\nHe had taken the Jones Beach Causeway, as always, because \\nit was usually deserted this time of night, at this time of year, \\nand he could speed recklessly until he hit the parkways on the \\nother side. And even there traffic would be light. The release \\nof driving very fast would help dissipate what he knew was a \\ndangerous tension. He had already left his bodyguards’ car \\nfar behind. \\n\\nThe causeway was badly lit, there was not a single car. Far \\nahead he saw the white cone of the manned tollbooth. There \\nwere other tollbooths beside it but they were staffed only dur- \\ning the day, for heavier traffic. Sonny started braking the \\nBuick and at the same time searched his pockets for change. \\nHe had none. He reached for his wallet, flipped it open with \\none hand and fingered out a bill. He came within the arcade \\nof light and he saw to his mild surprise a car in the tollbooth \\nslot blocking it, the driver obviously asking some sort of \\ndirections from the toll taker. Sonny honked his horn and the \\nother car obediently rolled through to let his car slide into the \\nslot., \\n\\nSonny handed the toll taker the dollar biU and waited for his \\nchange. He was in a hurry now to close the window. The \\nAtlantic Ocean air had chilled the whole car. But the toll taker \\nwas fumbling with his change; the dumb son of a bitch actually \\ndropped it. Head and body disappeared as the toll man stooped \\ndown in his booth to pick up the money. \\n\\nAt that moment Sonny noticed that ^e other car had not \\nkept going but had parked a few feet ahead, still blocking his \\nway. At that same moment his lateral vision caught sight of \\n\\n\\n270 \\n\\n\\n\\nanother man in the darkened tollbooth to his right. But he \\ndid not have time to think about that because two men came \\nout of the car parked in front and walked towards him. The \\ntoll collector still had not appeared. And then in the fraction \\nof a second before anything actually happened, Santino Cor- \\nleone knew he was a dead man. And in that moment his mind \\nwas lucid, drained of all violence, as if the hidden fear finally \\nreal and present had purified him. \\n\\nEven so, his huge body in a reflex for life, crashed through \\nthe Buick door, bursting its lock. The man in the darkened \\ntollbooth opened fire and the shots caught Sonny Corleone in \\nthe head and neck as his massive frame spilled out of the car. \\nThe two men in front held up their guns now, the man in the \\ndarkened tollbooth cut his fire, and Sonny’s body sprawled on \\nthe asphalt with the legs still partly inside. The two men each \\nfired shots into Sonny’s body, then kicked him in the face to \\ndisfigure his features even more, to show a mark made by \\na more personal human power. \\n\\nSeconds afterwards, all four men, the three actual assassins \\nand the bogus toll collector, were in their car and speeding \\ntowards the Meadowbrook Parkway on the other side of Jones \\nBeach. Their pursuit was blocked by Sonny’s car and body in \\nthe tollgate slot but when Soimy’s bodyguards pulled up a few \\nminutes later and saw his body lying there, they had no in- \\ntention to pursue. They swung their car around in a huge arc \\nand returned to Long Beach. At the first public phone off the \\ncauseway one of them hopped out and called Tom Hagen. He \\nwas very curt and very brisk. ‘ Sonny’s dead, they got him at \\nthe Jones Beach toll.’ \\n\\nHagen’s voice was perfectly calm. ‘OK,’ he said. ‘Go to \\nQemenza’s house and tell him to come here right away. He’D \\ntell you what to do,’ \\n\\nHagen had taken the call in the kitchen, with Mama Cor- \\nleonc bustling around preparing a snack for the arrival of her \\ndaughter. He had kept his composure and the old woman had \\nnot noticed anything amiss. Not that she could not have, if she \\nwanted to, but in her life with the Don she had learned it was \\nfu: wiser not to perceive. That if it was necessary to know any- \\nthing painful, it would be told to her soon enough. And if it \\n\\n\\n* 7 * \\n\\n\\n\\nWft8 a pain that could be spared her, she could do without. She \\nwas quite content not to share the pain of her men, after all \\ndid they share the pain of women? Impassively she boiled her \\ncoffee and set the tablf with food. In her experience pain and \\nfear did not dull physical hunger; in her experience the taking of \\nfood dulled pain. She would have beeh outraged if a doctor had \\ntried to sedate her with a drug, but coffee and a crust of bread \\nwere another matter; she came, of course, from a more primi- \\ntive culture. \\n\\nAnd so she let Tom Hagen escape to his corner conference \\nroom and once in that room, Hagen began to tremble so \\nviolently he had to sit down with his legs squeezed together, \\nhis head hunched into his contracted shoulders, hands dasped \\ntogether between his knees as if he were praying to the devil. \\n\\nHe was, he knew now, no fit Consigliort for a Family at war. \\nHe had been fooled, faked out, by the Five Families and their \\nseeming timidity. They had remained quiet, laying their terrible \\nambush. They had planned and waited, holding their bloody \\nhands no matter what provocation they had been given. They \\nhad waited to land one terrible blow. And they had. Old \\nGenco Abbandando would never have fallen for it, he would \\nhave smelled a rat, he would have smoked them out, tripled \\nhis precautions. And through all this Hagen felt his grief. Sonoy \\nhad been his true brother, his saviour; his hero when they had \\nbeen boys together. Sonny had never been mean or bullying \\nwith him, had always treated him with affection, had taken him \\nin his arms when SoUozzo had turned him loose. Sonny’s joy \\nat that reunion had been real. That he had grown up to be a \\ncruel and violent and bloody man was, for Hagen, not relevant. \\n\\nH^ had walked out of the kitchen because he knew he could \\nnever tell Mama Corleone about her son’s death. He had never \\nthought of her as his mother as he thought of the Don as his \\nfather and Sonny as his brother. His affection for her was like \\nhis affection for Freddie and Michael and Connie. The affec- \\ntion for someone who has been kind but not loving. But he \\ncould not tell her. In a few short months she had lost all her \\nsons; Freddie exiled to Nevada, Michael hiding for his life in \\nSicily, and now Santino dead. Which of the three had she loved \\nmost of aU? She had never shown. \\n\\n\\n* 7 * \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was flo more than a few minutes. Hagen got control of \\nhimself again and picked up the phone. He called Connie’s \\nnumber. It tang for a long time b^ore Connie answered in a \\nwhisper. \\n\\nHagen spoke to her gently. ‘Connie, this is Tom. Wake your \\nhusband up, I have to talk to him.’ \\n\\nConnie said in a low frightened voice, ‘ Tom, is Sonny com- \\ning here?* \\n\\n‘No,’ Hagen said. ‘Sonny’s not coming there. Don’t worry \\nabout that. Just wake Carlo up and tell him it’s very important \\n1 jpeak to Hm.’ \\n\\nConnie’s voice was weepy. ‘Tom, he beat me up, I’m afraid \\nhe’ll hurt me again if he Imows I called home.’ \\n\\nHagen said gently, ‘He won’t. He’ll talk to me and I’ll \\nstraighten him out. Everything will be OK. TeU him it’s very \\nimportant, very, very important he comes to the phone. OK?’ \\n\\nIt was almost five minutes before Carlo’s voice came over \\nthe phone, a voice half slurred by whisky and sleep. Hagen \\nspoke sharply to make him alert. \\n\\n‘Listen, Carlo,* he said, ‘I’m going to tell you something \\nvery shocking. Now prepare yourself because when I tell it to \\nyou I want you to answer me very casually as if it’s less than it \\nis. I told Connie it was important so you have to give her a \\nstory. Tell her the Family has decided to move you both to \\none of the houses in the mall and to give you a big job. That \\nthe Don has finally decided to give you a chance in the hope of \\nmaking your home life better. You got that?’ \\n\\nThere was a hopeful note in Carlo’s voice as he answered, \\n‘Yeah, OK.’ \\n\\nHagen went on, ‘In a few minutes a couple oFmy men are \\ngoing to knock on your door to take you away with them. Tell \\nthem I want them to call me first. Just tell them that. Don’t say \\nanything else. I’ll instruct them to leave you there with Connie. \\nOK?’ \\n\\n‘Yeah, yeah, I got it,’ Carlo said. His voice was excited. The \\ntension in Hagen’s voice seemed to have finally alerted him \\nthat the news coming up was going to be really important. \\n\\nHagen gave it to him straight. ‘They killed Sonny tonight. \\nDon’t say anything. Connie called him while you were asleep \\n\\n\\n^75 \\n\\n\\n\\nand he was on his way over there, but I don’t want her to know \\nthat, even if she guesses it, 1 dpn’t want her to know it for sure. \\nShe’ll start thinking it’s ail her fault. Now I want you to stay \\nwith her tonight and not tell her anything. I want you to make \\nup with her. I want you to be the perfect loving husband. And \\nI want you to stay that way until she has her baby at least. \\nTomorrow morning somebody, maybe you, maybe the Don, \\nmaybe her mother, will tell Connie that her brother got kiUed. \\nAnd I want you by her side. Do me this favour and I’ll take \\ncare of you in the times to come. You got that?’ \\n\\nCarlo’s voice was a little shaky. ‘ Sure, Tom, sure. Listen, me \\nand you always got along. I’m grateful. Understand?’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,* Hagen said. ‘Nobody will blame your fight with \\nConnie for causing this, don’t worry about that. I’ll take care \\nof that.’ He paused and softly, encouragingly, ‘Go ahead now, \\ntake care of Connie.’ He broke the connexion. \\n\\nHe had learned never to make a threat, the Don had taught \\nhim that, but Carlo had got the message all right : he was a hair \\naway from death. \\n\\nHagen made another call to Tessio, telling him to come to \\nthe mail in Long Beach immediately. He didn’t say why and \\nTessio did not ask. Hagen sighed. Now would come the part \\nhe dreaded. \\n\\nHe would have to waken the Don from his drugged slumber. \\nHe would have to tell the man he most loved in the world that \\nhe had failed him, that he had failed to guard his domain and \\nthe life of his eldest son. He would have to tell the Don every- \\nthing was lost unless the sick man himself could enter the \\nbattle. For Hagen did not delude himself. Only the great Don \\nhimself could snatch even a stalemate from this terrible defeat. \\nHagen didn’t even bother checking with Don Corleone’s doc- \\ntors, it would be to no purpose. No matter what the doctors \\nordered, even if they told him that the Don could not rise \\nfrom his sickbed on pain of death, he must tell his adopted \\nfather and then follow him. And of course there was no ques- \\ntion about what the Don would do. The opinions of medical \\nmen were irrelevant now, everything was irrelevant now. The \\nDon must be told and he must either take command or order \\nHagen to surrender the Corleone power to the Five Families. \\n\\n\\n*74 \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd yet with all his heart, Hagen dreaded the next hour. He \\ntried to prepare his own manner. He would have to be in all \\nways strict with his own guilt. To reproach himself would only \\nadd to the Don’s burden. To point out his own shortcomings \\nas a wartime Citnsiglioriy would only make the Don reproach \\nhimself for his own bad judgement for picking such a man for \\nsuch an important post. \\n\\nHe must, Hagen knew, tell the news, present his analysis of \\nwhat must be done to rectify the situation and then keep \\nsilent. His reactions thereafter must be the reactions invited by \\nhis Don. If the Don wanted him to show guilt, he would show \\nguilt; if the Don invited grief, he would lay bare his genuine \\nsorrow. \\n\\nHagen lifted his head at the sound of motors, cars rolling up \\non to the mall. The caporepmes were arriving. He would bti^ \\nthem £rst and then he would go up and wake Don G>rleone. \\nHe got up and went to the liquor cabinet by the desk and took \\nout a glass and bottle. He stood there for a moment so un- \\nnerved he could not pour the liquid from bottle to glass. Be- \\nhind him, he heard the door to the room close sofdy and, \\nturning, he saw, fully dressed for the first time since he had \\nbeen shot, Don Corlcone. \\n\\nThe Don walked across the room to his huge leather arm- \\nchair and sat down. He walked a little stiffly, his clothes hung \\na little loosely on his frame but to Hagen’s eyes he looked the \\nsame as always. It was almost as if by his will alone the Don \\nhad discarded all external evidence of his still weakened frame. \\nHis face was sternly set with all its old force and strength. He \\nsat straight in the armchair and he said to Hagen, *Give me a \\ndrop of anisette.’ \\n\\nHagen switched bottles and poured them both a portion of \\nthe fiery, liquorice-tasting alcohol. It was peasant, homemade \\nstuff, much stronger than that sold in stores, the gift of an old \\nfriend who every year presented the Don with a small truck- \\nload. \\n\\n* My wife was weeping before she fell asleep,’ Don G>rleone \\nsaid. * Outside my window I saw my eapor^gimis coming to the \\nhouse and it is midnight. So, Cansigliori of mine, I think you \\nshould tell your Don what everyone knows.’ \\n\\n\\n*75 \\n\\n\\n\\nHagen said quietly. * I didn\\'t tell Mama anything. I was about \\nto come up and wake you and tell you the news myself. In \\nanother moment 1 would have come to waken you.’ \\n\\nDon Corlcone said impassively, ‘But you needed a drink \\nfirst.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’ Hagen said. \\n\\n‘You’ve had your drink,* the Don said. ‘You can tell me \\nnow\\'.* There was just the faintest hint of reproach for Hagen’s \\nweakness. \\n\\n‘ They shot Sonny on the causeway,’ Hagen said. ‘ He’s dead.’ \\n\\nDon Q)rleone blinked. For just the fraction of a second the \\nwall of his will disintegrated and the draining of his physical \\nstrength was plain on his face. Then he recovered. \\n\\nHe clasped his hands in front of him on top of the desk and \\nlooked directly int6 Hagen’s eyes. ‘Tell me everything that \\nhappened,* he said. He held up one of his hands. ‘No, wait until \\nQemen2a and Tessio arrive so you won’t have to tell it all \\nagain.* \\n\\nIt was only a few moments later that the two caportgimts \\nwere escorted into the room by a bodyguard. They saw at once \\nthat the Don knew about his son’s death because the Don stood \\nup to receive them. They embraced him as old comrades were \\npermitted to do. They all had a drink of anisette which Hagen \\npoured them before he told them the story of that night. \\n\\nDon Corleone asked only one question at the end. ‘Is it \\ncertain my son is dead?* \\n\\nQemen2a answered. ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘The bodyguards were \\nof Santino’s regime but picked by me. I questioned them when \\nthey came to my house. They saw his body in the light of the \\ntollhouse. He could not live with the wounds they saw. They \\nplace their lives in forfeit for w\\'hat they say.* \\n\\nDon Corleone accepted this final verdict without any sign of \\nemotion except for a few moments of silence. Then he said, \\n‘None of you are to concern yourselves with this affair. None \\nof you are to commit any acts of vengeance, none of you are to \\nmake any inquiries to track down the murderers of my son \\nwithout my express command. There will be no further acts \\nof war against the Five Families without my express and per- \\nsonal wish. Our Family will cease ail business operations and \\n\\n176 \\n\\n\\n\\ncease to protect any of our business operations until after my \\nson’s funeral. Then we will meet here again and decide what \\nmust be done. Tonight we must do what we can for Santino, \\nwe must bury him as a Christian. I will have friends of mine \\narrange things with the police and all other proper authorities. \\nClemenza, you will remain with me at all times as my body- \\nguard, you and the men of your regime. Tessio, you will guard \\naU other members of my Family. Tom, I want you to call \\nAmerigo Bonasera and tell him I will need his services at some \\ntime during this night. To wait for me at his establishment. It \\nmay be an hour, two hours, three hours. Do you aU under- \\nstand that?’ \\n\\nThe three men nodded. Don Corleone said, ‘Qemen 2 a, get \\nsome men and cars and wait for me. 1 will be ready in a few \\nminutes. Tom, you did well. In the morning I want Con- \\nstanzia with her mother. Make arrangements for her and her \\nhusband to live in the mall. Have Sandra’s friends, the women, \\ngo to her house to stay with her. My wife wiU go there also \\nwhen I have spoken with her. My wife will tell her the mis- \\nfortune and the women will arrange for the church to say their \\nmasses and pray for his soul.’ \\n\\nThe Don got up from his leather armchair. The other men \\nrose with him and Oemenza and Tessio embraced him again. \\nHagen held the door open for the Don, who paused to look at \\nhim for a moment. Then the Don put his hand on Hagen’s \\ncheek, embraced him quickly, and said, in Italian, ‘You’ve \\nbeen a gdod son. You comfort me.’ Telling Hagen that he had \\nacted properly in this terrible time. The Don went up to his \\nbedroom to speak to his wife. It was then that Hagen made the \\ncall to Amerigo Bonasera for the undertaker to redeem the \\nfavour he owed to the Corleones. \\n\\n\\n*77 \\n\\n\\n\\nBook V \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY \\n\\nThe death of Santino Corleone sent shock waves through \\nthe underworld of the nation. And when it became known that \\nDon Corleone had risen from his sick bed to take charge of the \\nFamily affairs, when spies at the funeral reported that the Don \\nseemed to be fully recovered, the heads of the Five Families \\nmade frantic efforts to prepare a defence against the bloody \\nretaliatory war that was sure to follow. Nobody made the \\nmistake of assuming that Don Corleone could be held cheaply \\nbecause of his past misfortunes. He was a man who had made \\nonly a few mistakes in his career and had learned from every \\none of them. \\n\\nOnly Hagen guessed the Don^s real intentions and was not \\nsurprised when emissaries were sent to the Five Families to \\npropose a peace. Not only to propose a peace but a meeting of \\nall the Families in the city and with invitations to Families all \\nover the United States to attend. Since the New York Families \\nwere the most powerful in the country, it was understood that \\ntheir welfare affected the welfare of the country as a whole. \\n\\nAt first there were suspicions. Was Don Corleone preparing \\na trap? Was he trying to throw his enemies off their guard? \\nWas he attempting to prepare a wholesale massacre to avenge \\nhis son? But Don Corleone soon made it clear that he was \\nsincere. Not only did he involve all the Families in the country \\nin this meeting, but made no move to put his own people on \\na war footing or to enlist allies. And then he took the final \\nirrevocable step that established the authenticity of these in- \\ntentions and assured the safety of the grand council to be \\nassembled. He called on the services of the Bocchicchio \\nFamily. \\n\\nThe Bocchicchio Family was unique in that, once a parti- \\ncularly ferocious branch of the Mafia in Sicily, it had become \\n\\nZ7« \\n\\n\\n\\nan instrument of peace in America. Once a group of men who \\nearned their living by a savage determination, they now earned \\ntheir living in what perhaps could be called a saintly fashion. \\nThe Bocchicchios’ one asset was a closely knit structure of \\nblood relationships, a family loyalty severe even for a society \\nwhere family loyalty came before loyalty to a wife. \\n\\nThe Bocchicchio Family, extending out to third cousins, \\nhad once numbered nearly two hundred when they ruled the \\nparticular economy of a small section of southern Sicily. The \\nincome for the entire family then came from four or five flour \\nmills, by no means owned communaUy, but assuring labour \\nand bread and a minimal security for all Family members. This \\nwas enough, with intermarriages, for them to present a com- \\nmon front against their enemies. \\n\\nNo competing mill, no dam, that would create a water sup- \\nply to their competitors or ruin their own selling of water, was \\nallowed to be built in their corner of Sicily. A powerful land- \\nowning baron once tried to erect his own mill strictly for his \\npersonal use. The mill was burned down. He called on the \\ncarahineri and higher authorities, who arrested three of the \\nBocchicchio Family. Even before the trial the manor house of \\nthe baron was torched. The indictment and accusations were \\nwithdrawn. A few months later one of the highest functionaries \\nin the Italian government arrived in Sicily and tried to solve \\nthe chronic water shortage of that island by proposing a huge \\ndam. Engineers arrived from Rome to do surveys while \\nwatched by grim natives, members of the Bocchicchio clan. \\nPolice flooded the area, housed in a speciaUy built barracks. \\n\\nIt looked like nothing could stop the dam from being built \\nand supplies and equipment had actually been unloaded in \\nPalermo. That was as far as they got. The Bocchicchios had \\ncontacted fellow Mafia chiefs and extracted agreements for \\ntheir aid. The heavy equipment was sabotaged, the lighter \\nequipment stolen. Mafia deputies in the Italian Parliament \\nlaunched a bureaucratic counterattack against the planners. \\nThis went on for several years and in that time Mussolini came \\nto power. The dictator decreed that the dam must be built. It \\nwas not. The dictator had known that the Mafia would be a \\nthreat to his regime, forming what amoimted to a separate \\n\\n\\n^79 \\n\\n\\n\\nauthority from his own. He gave full powers to a high poUoe \\nofficial, who promptly solved the problem by throwing every* \\nbody into jail or deporting them to penal work islands. In a \\nfew short years he had broken the power of the Mafia, simply \\nby arbitrarily arresting anyone esren suspected of being a \\nmafioso. And so also brought ruin to a great many innocent \\nfamilies. \\n\\nThe Bocchicchios had been rash enough to resort to force \\nagainst this unlimited power. Half of the men were killed in \\narmed combat, the other half deported to penal island \\ncolonies. There were only a handful left when arrangements \\nwere made for them to emigrate to America via the clandestine \\nunderground route of jumping ship through Canada. There \\nwere almost twenty immigrants and they settled in a small \\ntown not far from New York City, in the Hudson Valley, \\nwhere by starting at the very bottom they worked their way \\nUp to owning a garbage hauling firm and their own trucks, \\nlliey became prosperous because they had no competition. \\nThey had no competition because competitors found their \\ntrucks burned and sabotaged. One persistent fellow who under- \\ncut prices was found buried in the garbage he had picked up \\nduring the day, smothered to death. \\n\\nBut as the men married, to Sicilian girls, needless to say, \\nchildren came, and the garbage business though providing a \\nliving, was not really enough to pay for the finer things \\nAmerica had to offer. And so, as a diversification, the Bocchic- \\nchio Family became negotiators and hostages in the peace \\nefforts of warring Mafia families. \\n\\nA strain of stupidity ran through the Bocchicchio clan, or \\nperhaps they were just primitive. In any case they recogniaed \\ntheir limitations and knew they could not compete with other \\nMafia families in the struggle to organize and control more \\nsophisticated business structures like prostitution, gambling, \\ndope, and public fraud, lliey were straight-from-the-shoulder \\npeople who could offer a gift to an ordinary patrolman but \\ndid not know how to approach a political bagman. They had \\nonly two assets. Their honour and their ferocity. \\n\\nA Bocchicchio never lied, never committ^ an act of \\ntreachery. Such behaviour was too complicated. Also, a \\n\\n280 \\n\\n\\n\\nBocchicchio never forgot an injury and never left it un- \\navenged no matter what the cost. And so by accident they \\nstumbled into what would prove to be their most lucrative \\nprofession. \\n\\nWhen warring families wanted to make peace and arrange a \\nparley, the Bocchicchio clan was contacted. The head of the \\nclan would handle the initial negotiations and arrange for the \\nnecessary hostages. For instance, when Michael had gone to \\nmeet Sollozao, a Bocchicchio had been left with the G^rleone \\nFamily as surety for Michael’s safety, the service paid for by \\nS0II0220. If Michael were killed by S0II0220, then the Boc- \\nchicchio male hostage held by the ^rleone Family would be \\nkilled by the Corleones. In this case the Bocchicchios would \\ntake their vengeance on Sollozzo as the cause of their clans- \\nman’s death. Since the Bocchicchios were so primitive, they \\nnever let anything, any kind of punishment, stand in their way \\nof vengeance. They would give up their own lives and there \\nwas no protection against them if they were betrayed. A \\nBocchicchio hostage was gilt-edged insurance. \\n\\nAnd so now when Don Corleone employed the Bocchicchios \\nas negotiators and arranged for them to supply hostages for all \\nthe Families to come to the peace meeting, there could be no \\nquestion as to his sincerity. There could be no question of \\ntreachery. The meeting would be as safe as a wedding. \\n\\nHostages given, the meeting took place in the director’s \\nconference room of a small commercial bank whose president \\nwas indebted to Don Corleone and indeed some of whose stock \\nbelonged to Don Corleone though it was in the president’s \\nname. The president always treasured that moment when he \\nhad offered to give Don Corleone a written document proving \\nhis ownership of the shares, to preclude any treachery. Don \\nCorleone had been horrified. ’I would trust you with my whole \\nfortune,’ he told the president. ‘I would trust you with my \\nlife and the welfare of my children. It is inconceivable to me \\nthat you would ever trick me or otherwise betray me. My \\nwhole world, all my faith in my judgement of human character \\nwould collapse. Of course I l^ve my own written records so \\nthat if something should happen to me my heirs would know \\nthat you hold something in trust for the^ But I know that \\n\\naSx \\n\\n\\n\\neven if I were not here in this world to guard the interests of \\nmy children, you would be faithful to their needs.* \\n\\nThe president of the bank, though not Sicilian, was a man of \\ntender sensibilities. He understood the Don perfectly. Now \\nthe Godfather’s request was the president’s command and so \\non a Saturday afternoon, the executive suite of the bank, the \\nconference room with its deep leather chairs, its absolute \\nprivacy, was made available to the Families. \\n\\nSecurity at the bank was taken over by a small army of hand* \\npicked men wearing bank guard uniforms. At ten o’clock on a \\nSaturday morning the conference room began to fill up. Be- \\nsides the Five Families of New York, there were representa- \\ntives from ten other Families across the country, with the \\nexception of Chicago, that black sheep of their world. They \\nhad given up trying to civilixe Chicago, and they saw no point \\nin including those mad dogs in this important conference. \\n\\nA bar had been set up and a small buffet. Each representative \\nto the conference had been allowed one aide. Most of the Dons \\nhad brought their Consigltoris as aides so there were compara- \\ntively few young men in the room. Tom Hagen was one of \\nthose young men and the only one who was not Sicilian. He \\nwas an object of curiosity, a freak. \\n\\nHagen knew his manners. He did not speak, he did not \\nsmile. He waited on his boss, Don Corleonc, with all the res- \\npect of a favourite earl waiting on his king; bringing him a \\ncold drink, lighting his cigar, positioning his ashtray; with \\nrespect but no obsequiousness. \\n\\nHagen was the only one in that room who knew the identity \\nof the portraits hanging on the dark panelled walls. They were \\nmostly portraits of fabulous financial figures done in rich oils. \\nOne was of Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. Hagen could \\nnot help thinking that Hamilton might have approved of this \\npeace meeting being held in a banking institution. Nothing \\nwas more calming, more conducive to pure reason, than the \\natmosphere of money. \\n\\nThe arrival time had been staggered for between nine-thirty \\nto ten AM. Don Corleone, in a sense the host since he had \\ninitiated the peace talks, had been the first to arrive; one of his \\nmany virtues was punctuality. The next to arrive was Girlo \\n\\n\\naSa \\n\\n\\n\\nTtamonti, who had made the southern part of the United \\nStates his territory. He was an impressively handsome middle- \\naged man, tall for a Sicilian, with a very deep sunburn, ex- \\nquisitely tailored and barbered. He did not look Italian, he \\nlooked more like one of those pictures in the magazines of \\nmillionaire fishermen lolling on their yachts. The Tramonti \\nFamily earned its livelihood from gambling, and no one meet- \\ning their Don would ever guess with what ferocity he had won \\nhis empire. \\n\\nEmigrating from Sicily as a small boy, he had settled in \\nFlorida and grown to manhood there, employed by the \\nAmerican syndicate of Southern small-town politicians who \\ncontrolled gambling. These were very tough men backed up \\nby very tough police officials and they never suspected that \\nthey could be overthrown by such a greenhorn immigrant. \\nThey were unprepared for his ferocity and could not match it \\nsimply because the rewards being fought over were not, to \\ntheir minds, worth so much bloodshed. Tramonti won over \\nthe police with bigger shares of the gross; he exterminated \\nthose redneck hooligans who ran their operation with such a \\ncomplete lack of imagination. It was Tramonti who opened \\nties with Cuba and the Batista regime and eventually poured \\nmoney into the pleasure resorts of Havana gambling houses, \\nwhorehouses, to lure gamblers from the American mainland, \\nTramonti was now a millionaire many times over and owned \\none of the most luxurious hotels in Miami Beach. \\n\\nWhen he came into the conference room followed by his \\naide, an equally sunburned Consigliori^ Tramonti embraced \\nDon Corleone, made a face of sympathy to show he sorrowed \\nfor the dead son. \\n\\nOther Dons were arriving. They all knew each other, they \\nhad met over the years, either socially or when in the pursuit \\nof their businesses. They had always showed each other \\nprofessional courtesies and in their younger, leaner days had \\ndone each other little services. The second Don to arrive was \\nJoseph Zaluchi from Detroit. The Zaluchi Family, under \\nappropriate disguises and covers, owned one of the horse- \\nracing tracks in the Detroit area. They also owned a good part \\nof the gambling. Zaluchi was a moon-faced, amiable-looking \\n\\n283 \\n\\n\\n\\nman who lived in a one-hundred-thousand-dollar house in the \\nfashionable Grosse Point section of Detroit. One of his tons \\nhad maixied into an old, well-known American family. Zilr \\nuchi, like Don Corleone, was sophisticated. Detroit had the \\nlowest incidence of physical violence of any of the cities ooo- \\ntrolled by the Families; there had been only two executions In \\nthe last three years in that city. He disapproved of traffic in \\ndrugs. \\n\\nZaluchi had brought his Consigliori with him and both men \\ncame to Don Corleone to embrace him. Zaluchi had a booming \\nAmerican voice with only the slightest trace of an accent. He \\nwas conservatively dressed, very businessman, and with a \\nhearty goodwill to match. He said to Don Corleone, *Only \\nyour voice could have brought me here.\\' Don Corleone bowed \\nhis head in thanks. He could count on Zaluchi for support. \\n\\nThe next two Dons to arrive were from the West Coast, \\nmotoring from there in the same car since they worked to- \\ngether closely in any case. They were Frank Falcone and \\nAnthony Molinari and both were younger than any of the \\nother men who would come to the meeting; in their early \\nforties. They were dressed a little more informally than the \\nothers, there was a touch of Hollywood in their style and they \\nwere a little more friendly than necessary. Frank Falcone con- \\ntrolled the movie unions and the gambling at the studios plus \\na complex of pipeline prostitution that supplied girls to the \\nwhorehouses of the states in the Far West. It was not in the \\nrealm of possibility for any Don to become ‘show biz\\' but \\nFalcone had just a touch. His fellow Dons distrusted him \\naccordingly. \\n\\n^thony Molinari controlled the waterfronts of San Fran- \\ncisco and was pre-eminent in the empire of sports gambling. \\nHe came of Italian fishermen stock and owned the best San \\nFrancisco sea food restaurant, in which he took such pride \\nthat the legend had it he lost money on the enterprise by giving \\ntoo good value for the prices charged. He had the impassive \\nface of the professional gambler and it was known that he also \\nhad something to do with dope smuggling over the Mexican \\nborder and from the ships plying the lanes of the oriental \\noceans. Their aides were young, powerfully built men, ob- \\n\\n284 \\n\\n\\n\\nviously not counsellors but bodyguards, though they would \\nnot dare to carry arms to this meeting. It was gener^ know- \\nledge that these bodyguards knew karate, a fact that amused \\nthe other Dons but did not alarm them in the slightest, no \\nmore than if the California Dons had come wearing amulets \\nblessed by the Pope. Though it must be noted that some of \\nthese men were religious and believed in God. \\n\\nNext arrived the representative from the Family in Boston. \\nThis was the only Don who did not have the respect of his \\nfcUows. He was known as a man who did not do right by his \\n‘people’, who cheated them unmercifully. This could be for- \\ngiven, each man measures his own greed. What could not be \\nforgiven was that he could not keep order in his empire. The \\nBoston area had too many murders, too many petty wars for \\npower, too many unsupported freelance activities; it flouted \\nthe law too brazenly. If the Chicago Mafia were savages, then \\nthe Boston people were gavoones. or uncouth louts ; ruffians. \\nThe Boston Don’s name was Domenick Panza. He was short, \\nsquat; as one Don put it, he looked like a thief. \\n\\nThe Cleveland syndicate, perhaps the most powerful of the \\nstrictly gambling operations in the United States, was repre- \\nsented by a sensitive-looking elderly man with gaunt features \\nand snow-white hair. He was known, of course not to his \\nface, as ‘the Jew’ because he had surrounded himself with \\nJewish assistants rather than Sicilians. It w^as even rumoured \\nthat he would have named a Jew as his Consigliori if he had \\ndared. In any case, as Don Corleone’s Family was known as \\nthe Irish Gang because of Hagen’s membership, so Don \\nVincent Forlenza’s Family was known as the Jewish Family \\nwith somewhat more accuracy. But he ran an extremely efficient \\norganization and he w^as not known ever to have fainted at \\nthe sight of blood, despite his sensitive features. He ruled with \\nan iron hand in a velvet political glove. \\n\\nThe representatives of the Five Families of New York were \\nthe last to arrive and Tom Hagen was struck by how much \\nmore imposing, impressive, these five men were than the out- \\nof-towners, the hicks. For one thing, the five New York Dons \\nwere in the old Sicilian tradition, they were ‘ tnen with a belly ’ \\nmeaning, figuratively, power and courage; and literally, \\n\\n285 \\n\\n\\n\\nphysical flesh, as if the two went together, as indeed they \\nseemed to have done in Sicily, The five New York Dons were \\nstout, corpulent men with massive leonine heads, features on a \\nlarge scale, fleshy imperial noses, thick mouths, heavy folded \\ncheeks. They were not too well tailored or barbetcd; they had \\nthe look of no-nonsense busy men without vanity. \\n\\nThere was Anthony Stracci, who controlled the New Jersey \\narea and the shipping on the West Side docks of Manhattan, \\nHe ran the gambling in Jersey and was very strong with the \\nDemocratic political machine. He had a fleet of freight hauling \\ntrucks that made him a fortune primarily because his trucks \\ncould travel with a heavy overload and not be stopped and \\nfined by highway weight inspectors. These trucks helped ruin \\nthe highways and then his road-building Arm, with lucrative \\nstate contracts, repaired the damage wrought. It was the kind \\nof operation that would warm any man*8 heart, business of \\nitself creating more business, Stracci, too, was old-fashioned \\nand never dealt in prostitution, but because his business was \\non the waterfront it was impossible for him not to be involved \\nin the drug-smuggling trafHc. Of the five New York Families \\nopposing the Corleones his was the least powerful but the \\nmost well disposed. \\n\\nThe Family that controlled upper New York State, that \\narranged smuggling of Italian immigrants from Canada, all up- \\nstate gambling, and exercised veto power on state licensing of \\nracing tracks, was headed by Ottilio Cuneo. This was a com- \\npletely disarming man with the face of a jolly round peasant \\nbaker, whose legitimate activity was one of the big milk com- \\npanies. Cuneo was one of those men who loved children and \\ncarried a pocket full of sweets in the hopes of being able to \\npleasure one of his many grandchildren or the small oflspring \\nof his associates. He wore a round fedora with the brim turned \\ndown all the way round like a woman’s sun hat, which broad- \\nened his already moon-shaped fiice into the mask of joviality. \\nHe was one of the few Dons who had never been arrested and \\nwhose true activities had never even been suspected. So much \\nso that he had served on civic committees and had been voted \\nas ‘Businessman of the Year for the State of New York’ by the \\nChamber of Commerce. \\n\\n\\nzS6 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe closest ally to the Tattaglia Family was Don Emilio \\nBarzini. He had some of the gambling in Brooklyn and some \\nin Queens. He had some prostitution. He had strong-arm. He \\ncompletely controlled Staten Island. He had some of the sports \\nbetting in the Bronx and Westchester. He was in narcotics. He \\nhad close ties to Qeveland and the West Coast and he was one \\nof the few men shrewd enough to be interested in Las Vegas \\nand Reno, the open cities of Nevada. He also had interests in \\nMiami Beach and Cuba. After the Corleone Family, his was \\nperhaps the strongest in New York and therefore in the coun- \\ntry. His influence reached even to Sicily. His hand was in every \\nunlawful pie. He was even rumoured to have a toehold in \\nWall Street. He had supported the Tattaglia Family with \\nmoney and influence since the start of the wai. It was his am- \\nbition to supplant Don Corleone as the most powerful and \\nrespected Mafia leader in the country and to take over part \\nof the Corleone empire. He was a man much like Don Coi- \\nleone, but more modern, more sophisticated, more business- \\nlike. He could never be called an old Moustache Pete and he \\nhad the confidence of the newer, younger, brasher leaders on \\ntheir way up. He was a man of great personal force in a cold \\nway, with none of Don Corleone’s warmth and he was perhaps \\nat this moment the most * respected’ man in the group. \\n\\nThe last to arrive was Don Phillip Tattaglia, the head of the \\nTattaglia FamDy that had directly challenged the Corleone \\npower by supporting Sollozzo, and had so nearly succeeded. \\nAnd yet curiously enough he was held in a slight contempt by \\nthe others. For one things it was known that he had allowed \\nhimself to be dominated by Sollozzo, had in fact been led by \\nthe nose by that fine Turkish hand. He was held ^responsible \\nfor aU this commotion, this uproar that had so affected the \\nconduct of everyday business by the New York Families. Also \\nhe was a sixty-year -old dandy and woman-chaser. And he had \\nample opportunity to indulge his weakness. \\n\\nFor the Tattaglia Family dealt in women. Its main business \\nwas prostitution. It also controlled most of the nightclubs in \\nthe United States and could place any talent anywhere in the \\ncountry. Phillip Tattaglia was not above using strong-atm to \\nget control of promising singers and comics and muscling in \\n\\n287 \\n\\n\\n\\non record firms. But prostitution was the main source of the \\nFamily income. \\n\\nHis personality was unpleasant to these men. He was a \\nwhiner, always complaining of the costs in his Family business. \\nLaundry bills, all those towels, ate up the profits (but he owned \\nthe laundry firm that did the work). The girls were la2y and \\nunstable, running off, committing suicide. The pimps were \\ntreacherous and dishonest aifd without a shred of loyalty. \\nGood help was hard to find. Young lads of Sicilian blo<^ \\nturned up their noses at such work, considered it beneath their \\nhonour to traffic and abuse women; those rascals who would \\nslit a throat with a song on their lips and the cross of an Easter \\npalm in the lapel of their jackets. So Phillip Tattaglia would \\nrant on to audiences unsympathetic and contemptuous. His \\nbiggest howl was reserved for authorities who had it in their \\npower to issue and cancel liquor licences for his nightclubs and \\ncabarets. He swore he had made more millionaires than Wall \\nStreet with the money he had paid those thieving guardians of \\nofficial seals. \\n\\nIn a curious way his almost victorious war against the Cor- \\nleone Family had not won him the respect it deserved. They \\nknew his strength had come first from S0II0220 and then from \\nthe Barzini Family. Also the fact that with the advantage of \\nsurprise he had not Won complete victory was evidence against \\nhim. If he had been more efficient, all this trouble could have \\nbeen avoided. The death of Don Corlcone would have meant \\nthe end of the war. \\n\\nIt was proper, since they had both lost sons in their war \\nagainst each other, that Don Corleone and Phillip Tattaglia \\nshojuld acknowledge each other’s presence only with a formal \\nnod. Don Corleone was the object of attention, the other men \\nstudying him to see what mark of weakness had been left On \\nhim by his wounds and defeats. The puzzling factor was why \\nDon Corleone had sued for peace after the death of his fav- \\nourite son. It was an acknowledgement of defeat and would \\nalmost surely lead to a lessening of his power. But they would \\nsoon know. \\n\\nThere were greetings, there were drinks to be served and \\nalmost another half hour went by before Don Corleone took \\n\\n288 \\n\\n\\n\\nhis scat at the polished walnut table. Unobtrusively, Hagra \\nsat in thft rhflir slightly to the Don*s left and behind him. *llii8 \\nwas signal for the other Dons to make their way to die \\ntable. Their aides sat behind them, the Consiglioris up close so \\nthey could offer any advice when needed. \\n\\nDon Corleone was the first to speak and he spoke as If \\nnothing had happened. As if he had not been grievously \\nwounded and his eldest son slain, his empire in a shambles, his \\npersonal family scattered, Freddie in the West and under the \\nprotection of the Molinari Family and Michael secreted so \\nthe wastelands of Sicily. He spoke naturally, in Sicilian dialect. \\n\\n‘I want to thank you all for coming,* he said. ‘ I consider it a \\nservice done to me personally and I am in the debt of each and \\nevery one of you. And so I will say at the beginning that 1 am \\nhere not to quarrel or convince, but only to reason and as a \\nreasonable man do everything possible for us all to past \\nfriends here too. I give my word on that, and some of you who \\nknow me well know I do not give my word lighdy. Ah, well, \\nlet’s get down to business. We are all honourable men here, \\nwe don’t have to give each other assurances as if we were \\nlawyers.’ \\n\\nHe paused. None of the others spoke. Some were smoking \\ncigars, others sipping their drinks. All of these men were good \\nlisteners, patient men. They had one other thing in common. \\nThey were those rarities, men who had refused to accept the \\nrule of organized society, men who refused the domimon of \\nother men. There was no force, no mortal man who could \\nbend them to their will unless they wished it. They were inen \\nwho guarded their free will with wiles and murder. Their wills \\ncould be subverted only by death. Or the utmosfrcasonable- \\nness. \\n\\nDon Corleone sighed. ‘How did things ever go so far?’ he \\nasked rhetorically. ‘Well, no matter. A lot of foolishness has \\ncome to pass. It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary. But let \\nme tell what happened, as I see it.’ \\n\\nHe paused to see if someone would object to his telling his \\nside of the story. \\n\\n‘Thank God my health has been restored and maybe I can \\nset this affair adght. Perhaps my son was too rash, too \\n\\naf9 \\n\\n\\n— 10 \\n\\n\\n\\nheadstrong, T don’t say no to that. Anyway let me just say that \\nS0U0Z20 came to me with a business affair in which he asked \\nme for my money and my influence. He said he had the interest \\nof the Tattaglia Family. The affair involved drugs, in which I \\nhave no interest. I’m a quiet man and such endeavours are too \\nlively for my taste. I explained this to Soliozzo, with all re- \\nspect for him and the Tattaglia Family. I gave him my “no” \\nwith all courtesy. 1 told him his business would not interfere \\nwith mine, that I had no objection to his earning his living in \\nthis fashion. He took it ill and brought misfortune down on all \\nour heads. Well, that’s life. Everyone here could tell his own \\ntalc of sorrow. That’s not to my purpose.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone paused and motioned to Hagen for a cold \\ndrink, which Hagen swiftly furnished him. Don Corleone wet \\nhis mouth. ‘I’m willing to make the peace,’ he said. ‘Tattaglia \\nhas lost a son, I have lost a son. W^e are quits. What would the \\nworld come to if people kept carrying grudges against all \\nreason? That has been the cross of Sicily, where men are so \\nbusy with vendettas they have no time to earn bread for their \\nfamilies. It’s foolishness. So I say now, let things be as they \\nwere before. I have not taken any steps to learn who betrayed \\nand killed my son. Given peace, I will not do so, I have a son \\nwho cannot come home and 1 must receive assurances (hat \\nwhen 1 arrange matters so that he can return safely that there \\nwill be no interference, no danger from the authorities. Once \\nthat’s settled maybe we can talk about other matters that \\ninterest us and do ourselves, all of us, a profitable service \\ntoday.’ Corleone gestured expressively, submissively, with his \\nhands. ‘That is all I want.’ \\n\\nIt was very well done. It was the Don Corleone of old. \\nReasonable. Pliant. Soft-spoken. But every man there had \\nnoted that he had claimed good health, which meant he was a \\nman not to be held cheaply despite the misfortunes of the \\nCorleone Family. It was noted that he had said the discussion \\nof other business was useless until the peace he asked for was \\ngiven. It was noted that he had asked for the old status quo, \\nthat he would lose nothing despite his having got the worst \\nof it over the past year. \\n\\nHowever, it was Emilio Barzini who answered Don Cor- \\n\\n290 \\n\\n\\n\\nleone, not Tattaglia. He was curt and to the point without \\nbeing rude or insulting. \\n\\n*That is all true enough/ Barzini said. *But there’s a little \\nmore. Don Corleone is too modest. The fact is that Sollozzo \\nand the Tattaglias could not go into their new business without \\nthe assistance of Don Corleone. In fact, his disapproval injured \\nthem. That’s not his fault of course. The fact remains that \\njudges and politicians who would accept favours from Don \\nCorleone, even on drugs, would not allow themselves to be \\ninfluenced by anybody else w\\'hen it came to narcotics. Soh \\nlozzo couldn’t operate if he didn’t have some insurance of his \\npeople being treated gendy. We all know that. We would all \\nbe poor men otherwise. And now that they have increased the \\npenalties the judges and the prosecuting attorneys drive a hard \\nbargain when one of our people gets in trouble with narcotics. \\nEven a Sicilian sentenced to twenty years might break the \\nomerta and talk his brains out. That can’t happen, Don Cor- \\nleone controls all that apparatus. His refusal to let us use it is \\nnot the act of a friend. He takes the bread out of the mouths \\nof our families. Times have changed, it’s not like the old days \\nwhere everyone can go his own way. If Corleone has all the \\njudges in New York, then he must share them or let us others \\nuse them. Certainly he can present a bill for such services, wc’rc \\nnot communists, after all. But he has to let us draw water \\nfrom the well. It’s that simple.’ \\n\\nWhen Barzini had finished talking there was a silence. The \\nlines were now drawn, there could be no return to the old \\nstatus quo. What was more important was that Barzini by \\nspeaking out was saying that if peace was not m^e he would \\nopenly join the Tattaglia in their war against the Corleone. \\nAnd he had scored a telling point. Their lives and their for- \\ntunes depended upon their doing each other services, the \\ndenial of a favour asked by a friend was an act of aggression. \\nFavours were not asked lightly and so could not be lightly \\nrefused. \\n\\nDon Corleone finally spoke to answer. ‘ My friends,’ he said, \\n‘I didn’t refuse out of spite. You all know me. When have I \\never refused an acconunodadon? That’s simply not in my \\nnature. But I had to refuse this time. Why? Because I think \\n\\n\\n291 \\n\\n\\n\\nthis drug business will destroy us in the years to come. There \\nis too much strong feeling al^ut such traffic in this country. \\nIt*s not like whisky or gambling or even women which most \\npeople want and is forbidden them by the pev^i^pnovanU of the \\nchurch and the government. But drugs are dangerous for \\neveryone connected with them. It could jeopardize all other \\nbusiness. And let me say Tm flattered by the bdief that I am so \\npowerful widi the judges and law officials, I wish it were true. \\nI do have some influence but many of the people who respect \\nmy counsel might lose this respect if drugs become involved \\nin our relationship. They are afraid to he involved in such \\nbusiness and they have strong feelings about it. Even police- \\nmen who help us in gambling and other things would refuse \\nto help in drugs. So to ask me to perform a service in these \\nmatters is to ask me to do a disservice to myself. But Tm will- \\ning to do even that if all of you think it proper in order to \\nadjust other matters.’ \\n\\nWhen Don ODrlcone had finished speaking the room be- \\ncame much more relaxed with more whisperings and cross \\ntalk. He had conceded the important point. He would ofler \\nhis protection to any organized business venture in drugs. He \\nwas, in effect, agreeing almost entirely to Sollozzo’s original \\nproposal if that proposal was endorsed by the national group \\ngathered here. It was understood that he would never parti- \\ncipate in the operational phase, nor would he invest his money. \\nHe would merely use his protective influence with the legal \\napparatus. But this was a formidable concession. \\n\\nThe Don of Los Angeles, Frank Falcone, spoke to answer. \\n‘There’s no way of stopping our people from going into that \\nbusiness. They go in on their own and get in trouble. There’s \\ntoo much money in it to resist.. So it’s more dangerous if we \\ndon’t go in. At least if we control it we can cover it better, \\norganize it better, make sure it causes less trouble. Being in it \\nis not so bad, there has to be control, there has to be protec- \\ntion, there has to be organization, we can’t have everybody \\nrunning around doing just what they please like a bunch of \\nanarchists.’ \\n\\nThe Don of Detroit, more fldendly to Codeone than any cf \\ndie ollicn, abo now against his fiieod’s posftkin, in Ac \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\niiitetest of reasonableness. don^t believe in drugs/ he said. \\n‘For years I paid my people extra so they woul^\\'t do that \\nkind of business. But it didn’t matter, it didn’t help. Somebody \\ncomes to them and says, have powders, if you put up the \\nthree-, four-thousand-doUar investment we can make fifty \\nthousand distributing.” Who can resist such a profit? And they \\nare so busy with their little side business they neglect the work \\nI pay them to do. There’s more money in drugs. It’s getting \\nbigger all the time. There’s no way to stop it so we have to \\ncontrol the business and keep it respectable. I don’t want any \\nof it near schools, I don’t want any of it sold to children. That \\nis an infamita. In my city I would try to keep the traffic in the \\ndark people, the coloured. They are the b^t customers, die \\nleast troublesome and they are animals anyway. They have no \\nrespect for their wives or their families or for themselves. Let \\nthem lose their souls with drugs. But something has to be done, \\nwe just can’t let people do as they please and make trouble £6r \\neveryone.’ \\n\\nThis speech of the Detroit Don was received with loud mur- \\nmurs of approval. He had hit the nail on the head. You couldn’t \\neven pay people to stay out of the drug traffic. As for his re- \\nmarks about children, that was his well-known sensibility, his \\ntenderheartedness speaking. After all, who would sell drugs to \\nchildren? Where would children get the money? As for his \\nremarks about the coloureds, tb^t was not even heard. The \\nNegroes were considered of absolutely no account, of no force \\nwhatsoever. That they had allowed society to grind them into \\nthe dust proved them of no account and his mentioning them \\nin any way proved that the Don of Detroit had a mind that \\nalways wavered towards irrelevancies. \\n\\nAll the Dons spoke. All of them deplored the traffic in drugs \\nas a bad thing that would cause trouble but agreed there was no \\nway to control it. There was, simply, too much money to be \\nmade in the business, therefore it followed that there would be \\nmen who would dare anything to dabble in it. That was human \\nnature. \\n\\nIt was finally agreed. Drug traffic vrould be permitted and \\nDon Corleone must give it some legal protection in the East. \\nIt understood that the Barzini and Tattaglia Families \\n\\n\\n*93 \\n\\n\\n\\nwould do most of the large-scale operations. With this out of \\nthe way the conference was able to move on to other matters \\nof a wider interest. There were many complex problems to be \\nsolved. It was agreed that Las Vegas and Miami were to be \\nopen cities where any of the Families could operate. They all \\nrecognized that these were the cities of the future. It was also \\nagreed that no violence would be permitted in these cities and \\nthat petty criminals of all types were to be discouraged. It was \\nagreed that in momentous affairs, in executions that were neces- \\nsary but might cause too much of a public outcry, the execu- \\ntion must be approved by this council. It was agreed that \\nbutton men and other soldiers were to be restrained from \\nviolent crimes and acts of vengeance against each other on \\npersonal matters. It was agreed that Families would do each \\nother services when requested, such as providing executioners, \\ntechnical assistance in pursuing certain courses of action such \\nas bribing jurors, which in some instances could be vital. These \\ndiscussions, informal, colloquial, and on a high level, took time \\nand were broken by lunch and drinks from the bufiet bar. \\n\\nFinally Don Barzini sought to bring the meeting to an end. \\n‘That’s the whole matter then,’ he said. ‘We have the peace \\nand let me pay my respects to Don G^rleonc, whom we all \\nhave known over the years as a man of his word. If there arc \\nany more differences we can meet again, we need not become \\nfoolish again. On my part the road is new and fresh. I’m glad \\nthis is all settled.’ \\n\\nOnly Phillip Tattaglia was a little worried still. The murder \\nof Santino Corleone made him the most vulnerable person in \\nthis group if war broke out again. He spoke at length for the \\nfirst time. \\n\\n‘I’ve agreed to everything here. I’m willing to forget my \\nown misfortune. But I would like to hear some strict assur- \\nances from Corleone. WiU he attempt any individual ven- \\ngeance? When time goes by and his position perhaps becomes \\nstronger, will he forget that we have sworn our friendship? \\nHow am I to know that in three or four years he won’t feel \\nthat he’s been ill served^ forced against his will to this agree- \\nment and so free to break it? Will we have to guard against \\neach other all the time? Or can we truly go in peace with peace \\n\\n\\n*94 \\n\\n\\n\\nof mind? Would Corlcone give us all his assurances as I now \\ngive mine?’ \\n\\nIt was then that Don Corlcone gave the speech that would \\nbe long remembered, and that reaffirmed his position as the \\nmost far-seeing statesman among them, so fuU of common \\nsense, so direct from the heart; and to the heart of the matter. \\nIn it he coined a phrase that was to become as famous in its way \\nas Churchill’s Iron Curtain, though not public knowledge \\nuntil more than ten years later. \\n\\nFor the first time he stood up to address the council. He was \\nshort and a little thin from his \\'illness*, perhaps his sixty years \\nshowed a bit more but there was no question that he had \\nregained all his former strength, and had all his wits. \\n\\n‘ What manner of men arc we then, if we do not have our \\nreason,’ he said. \\' We are aU no better than beasts in a jungle \\nif that were the case. But we have reason, we can reason with \\neach other and we can reason with ourselves. To what pur- \\npose would I start all these troubles again, the violence and the \\nturmoil? My son is dead and that is a misfortune and 1 must \\nbear it, not make the innocent world around me suffer with \\nme. And so I say, I give my honour, that I will never seek \\nvengeance, I will never seek knowledge of the deeds that have \\nbeen done in the past. I will leave here with a pure heart. \\n\\n‘ Let me say that we must always look to our interests. We \\nare all men who have refused to be fools, who have refused to \\nbe puppets dancing on a string pulled by the men on high. We \\nhave been fortunate here in this country. Already most of our \\nchildren have found a better life. Some of you have sons who \\nare professors, scientists, musicians, and you arc fortunate. \\nPerhaps your grandchildren will become the n€V7*pe:(p^onovanti, \\nNone of us here want to sec our children follow in our foot- \\nsteps, it’s too hard a life. They can be as others, their position \\nand security won by our courage. I have grandchildren now \\nand I hope their children may someday, who knows, be a \\ngovernor, a President, nothing’s impossible here in America. \\nBut we have to progress with the times. The time is past for \\nguns and killings and massacres. We have to be cunning like \\nthe business people, there’s more money in it and it’s better for \\nour children and our grandchildren. \\n\\n\\n*95 \\n\\n\\n\\n*As for our own deeds, we are not responsible for the .90 \\ncalibres, the pev^p^wanti who take it upon themselves to \\ndecide what we shall do with our lives, who declare wars they \\nwish us to fight in to protect what they own. Who is to say \\nwe should obey the laws they make for their own interest and \\nto our hurt? And who are they then to meddle when we look \\nafter our own interests? Sonna cosa nostra^ Don Corleone said, \\n‘these arc our own affairs. We will manage our world for our- \\nselves because it is our world, cosa nostra. And so we have to \\nstick together to guard against outside meddlers. Otherwise \\nthey will put the ring in our nose as they have put the ring in \\nthe nose of all the millions of Neapolitans and other Italians \\nin the country. \\n\\n‘For this reason I forgo my vengeance for my dead son, for \\nthe common good. I swear now that as long as I am respon- \\nsible for the actions of my Family there will not be one finger \\nlifted against any man here without just cause and utmost \\nprov<Kation. I am willing to sacrifice my commercial interests \\nfor the common good. This is my word, this is my honour, \\nthere arc those of you here who know I have never betrayed \\neither. \\n\\n‘ But I have a selfish interest. My youngest son had to flee, \\naccused of SoUozzo’s murder and that of a police captain. I \\nmust now make arrangements so that he can come home with \\nsafety, cleared of all those false charges. That is my afiair and \\n1 will make those arrangements. I must find the real culprits \\nperhaps, or perhaps I must convince the authorities of his \\ninnocence, perhaps the witnesses and informants will recant \\ntheir lies. But again I say that this is my affair and I believe I \\nwill be able to bring my son home. \\n\\n‘But let me say this. I am a superstitious man, a ridiculous \\nfailing but I must confess it here. And so if some unlucky acci- \\ndent should befall my youngest son, if some police ofRcer \\nshould accidentally shoot him, if he should hang himself in his \\ncell, if new witnesses appear to testify to his guilt, my super- \\nstition will make me feel that it was the result of the ill will still \\nborne me by some people here. Let me go further. If my son \\nis struck by a bolt of lightning I will blame some of the people \\nhere. If his plane should fall into the sea or his ship sink be- \\n\\n296 \\n\\n\\n\\nneath the waves of the ocean, if he should catch a mortal fever, \\nif his automobile should be struck by a train, such is my super- \\nstition that I would blame the ill will felt by people here. \\nGendemen, that ill will, that bad luck, I could never forgive. \\nBut aside from that let me swear by the souls of my grand- \\nchildren that 1 will never break the peace we have made, /ihct \\nall, are we or arc we not better men than those pe!(j(pnopan/i \\nwho have killed coundess millions of men in our lifetimes?* \\n\\nWith this Don Corlcone stepped from his place and went \\ndown the table to where Don Phillip Tattaglia was sitting. \\nTattaglia rose to greet him and the two men embraced, kissing \\neach other’s cheeks. The other Dons in the room applauded \\nand rose to shake hands with everybody in sight and to con- \\ngratulate Don Corleone and Don Tattaglia on their new \\nfriendship. It was not perhaps the warmest friendship in the \\nworld, they would not send each other Christmas gift greetings, \\nbut they would not murder each other. That was friendship \\nenough in this world, all that was needed. \\n\\nSince his son Freddie was under the protection of the \\nMolinari Family in the West, Don Corleone lingered with the \\nSan Francisco Don after the meeting to thank him* Molinari \\nsaid enough for Don Corleone to gather that Freddie had \\nfound his niche out there, was happy and had become some- \\nthing of a ladies’ man. He had a genius for running a hotel, it \\nseemed. Don Corleone shook his head in wonder, as many \\nfathers do when told of undreamed-of talents in their children. \\nWasn’t it true that sometimes the greatest misfortunes brought \\nunforeseen rewards? They both agreed that this was so. Mean- \\nwhile Corleone made it clear to the San Francisco Don that he \\nwas in his debt for the great service done in protecting Freddie. \\nHe let it be known that his influence would be exerted so that \\nthe important racing wires would always be available to his \\npeople ho matter what changes occurred in the power struc- \\nture in the years to come, an important guarantee since the \\nover this facility was a constant open wound com- \\nplicated by the fact that the Chicago people had their heavy \\nhand in it. But Don Corleone was not without influence even \\nin that land of barbarians, and so his promise was a gift of gold. \\n\\nIt was evening before Don Corleone, Tom Hagen, and the \\n\\n\\n297 \\n\\n\\n\\nbodyguard-chauffeur, who happened to be Rocco Lampone, \\narrived at the mall in Long Beach. When they went into the \\nhouse the Don said to Hagen, ‘ Our driver, that man Lampone, \\nkeep an eye on him. He’s a fellow worth something better I \\nthink.’ Hagen wondered at this remark. Lampone had not said \\na word all day, had not even glanced at the two men in the \\nback seat. He had opened the door for the Don, the car had \\nbeen in front of the bank when they emerged, he had done \\neverything correctly but no more than any well-trained chauf- \\nfeur might do. Evidently the Don’s eye had seen something he \\nhad not seen. \\n\\nThe Don dismissed Hagen and told him to come back to the \\nhouse after supper. But to take his time and rest a little since \\nthey would put in a long night of discussion. He also told \\nHagen to have Clemenza and Tessio present. They shobld \\ncome at lo pm, not before. Hagen was to brief Clemenza and \\nTessio on what had happened at the meeting that afternoon. \\n\\nAt ten the Don was waiting for the three men in his office, \\nthe corner room of the house with its law library and special \\nphone. There was a tray with whisky bottles, ice, and soda \\nwater. The Don gave his instructions. \\n\\n*We made the peace this afternoon,’ he said. ‘I gave my \\nword and my honour and that should be enough for all of you. \\nBut our friends are not so trustworthy so let’s all be on our \\nguard still. We don’t want any more nasty little surprises.’ \\nThe Don turned to Hagen, ‘You’ve let the Bocchicchio hos- \\ntages go?’ \\n\\nHagen nodded. ‘ I called Clememsa as soon as I got home.’ \\n\\nCorleone turned to the massive Clemenza. The caporegime \\nnodded. ‘I released them. Tell me. Godfather, is it possible for \\na Sicilian to be as dumb as the Bocchicchios pretend to be?’ \\n\\nDon Corleone smiled a little. ‘They are clever enough to \\nmake a good living. Why is it so necessary to be more dever \\nthan that? It’s not the Bocchicchios who cause the troubles of \\nthis world. But it’s true, they haven’t got the Sicilian head.’ \\n\\nThey were all in a relaxed mood, now that the war was over. \\nDon Corleone himself mixed drinks and brought one to each \\nman. The Don sipped his carefully and lit up a dgar. \\n\\n‘I Want nothing set forth to discover what happened to \\n\\n298 \\n\\n\\n\\nSonny, that*s done with and to be forgotten. I want all co- \\noperation with the other Families even if they become a little \\ngreedy and we don\\'t get our proper share in things. I want \\nnothing to break this peace no matter what the provocation \\nuntil weVc found a way to bring Michael home. And I want \\nthat to be first thing on your minds. Remember this, when he \\ncomes back he must come back in absolute safety. I don\\'t mean \\nfrom the Tattaglias or the Barsinis. What Fm concerned about \\nare the police. Sure, we can get rid of the real evidence against \\nhim; that waiter won\\'t testify, nor that spectator or gunman \\nor whatever he was. I\\'hc real evidence is the least of our worries \\nsince we know about it. What wc have to worry about is the \\npolice framing false evidence because their informers have \\nassured them that Michael Corleone is the man who killed their \\ncaptain. Very well. We have to demand that the Five Families \\ndo everything in their power to correct this belief of the police. \\nAll their informers who work with the police must come up \\nwith new stories. I think after my speech this afternoon they \\nwill understand it is to their interest to do so. But that\\'s not \\nenough. We have to come up with something special so Michael \\nwon\\'t ever have to worry about that again. Otherwise there\\'s \\nno point in him coming back to this country. So let\\'s all think \\nabout that. That\\'s the most important matter. \\n\\n*Now, any man should be allowed one foolishness in his \\nlife. I have had mine. 1 want all the land around die mall \\nbought, the houses bought. I don\\'t want any man able to look \\nout his window into my garden even if it’s a mile away. I want \\na fence around the mall and I want the mall to be on full pro- \\ntection all the time. I want a gate in that fence. In short, I wish \\nnow to live in a fortress. Let me say to you now that I will \\nnever go into the city to work again. I will be semi-retired. I \\nfeel an urge to work in the garden, to make a little wine when \\nthe grapes arc in season. I want to live in my house. The only \\ntime rU leave is to go on a litdc vacation or to sec someone on \\nimportant business and then I want all precautions taken. Now \\ndon\\'t take this amiss. I\\'m not preparing anything. I’m being \\nprudent. I\\'ve always been a prudent man, there is nothing I \\nfind so litde to my taste as carelessness in life. Women and \\nchildren can afford to be careless, men cannot. Be leisurely in \\n\\n\\n299 \\n\\n\\n\\nall these things, no fnntic ptepaiations to alarm our friends. \\nIt can be done in such a way as to seem natural. \\n\\n\\'Now I’m going to leave things more and more up to each \\nof you three. I want the Santino regime disbanded and the men \\nplaced in your regimes. That should reassure our friends and \\nshow that I mean peace. Tom, I want you to put together a \\ngroup of men who will go to Las Vegas and give me a full \\nreport on what is going on out there. Tell me about Fredo, \\nwhat is really happening out there. I hear I wouldn’t recognize \\nmy own son. It seems he’s a cook now, that he amuses himself \\nwith young girls more than a grown man should. Well, he was \\nalways too serious when he was young and he was never the \\nman for Family business. But let’s find out what really can be \\ndone out there.’ \\n\\nHagen said quietly, \\' Should we send your son-in-law? After \\nall. Carlo is a native of Nevada, he knows his way around.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone shook his head. \\'No, my wife is lonely here \\nwithout any of her children. I want Constanzia and her hus- \\nband moved into one of the houses on the mall. 1 want Carlo \\ngiven a responsible job, maybe I’ve been too harsh on him, \\nand ’ ~ Don Corleone made a grimace - \\' I’m short of sons. Take \\nhim out of the gambling and put him in with the unions where \\nhe can do some paper work and a lot of talking. He’s a good \\ntalker.’ There was the tiniest note of contempt in the Don’s \\nvoice. \\n\\nHagen nodded. *OK, Clemenza and I will go over all the \\npeople and put together a group to do the Vegas job. Do you \\nwant me to call Freddie home for a few days?’ \\n\\nThe Don shook his head. He said cruelly, \\'What for? My \\nwife can still cook our meals. Let him stay out there.’ The \\nthree men shifted uneasily in their seats. They had not realized \\nFreddie was in such severe disfavour with his father and they \\nsuspected it must be because of something they did not know. \\n\\nDon Corleone sighed. \\'1 hope to grow some good green \\npeppers and tomatoes in the garden this year, more than we can \\neat. rU make you presents of them. I want a little peace, a littk \\nquiet and tranquillity for my old age. Well, that’s all. Have \\nanother drink if you like.’ \\n\\nIt was a dismissal. The men rose. Hagen accompanied \\n\\njoo \\n\\n\\n\\nQemcnza and Tessio to dieir cars and arranged meetings with \\nthem to thrash out the operational details that would accom- \\nplish the stated desires of their Don. Then he went back into \\nthe house where he knew Don Corleone would be waiting for \\nhim. \\n\\nThe Don had taken off his jacket and tie and was lying down \\non the couch. His stern face was relaxed into lines of fatigue. \\nHe waved Hagen into a chair and said, \\'Well, Consigliori^ do \\nyou disapprove of any of my deeds today?’ \\n\\nHagen took his time answering. ‘No,’ he said. ‘But I don’t \\nfind it consistent, nor true to your nature. You say you don’t \\nwant to find out how Santino was killed or want vengeance \\nfor it. I don’t believe that. You gave your word for peace and \\nso you’U keep the peace but I can’t believe you will give your \\nenemies the victory they seem to have won today. You’ve con- \\nstructed a magnificent riddle that 1 can’t solve, so how can I \\napprove or disapprove?’ \\n\\nA look of content came over the Don’s face. ‘Well, you \\nknow me better than anyone else. Even though you’re not a \\nSicilian, I made you one. Everything you say is true, but there’s \\na solution and you’ll comprehend it before it spins out to the \\nend. You agree everyone has to take my word and I’ll keep my \\nword. And I want my orders obeyed exactly. But, Tom, the \\nmost important thing is we have to get Michael home as soon \\nas possible. Make that first in your mind and in your work. \\nExplore all the legal alleys, I don’t care how much money you \\nhave to spend. It has to be foolproof when he comes home. \\nConsult Ac best lawyers on criminal law. I’ll give you Ac \\nnames of some judges who will give you a private auAence. \\nUntil Aat time we have to guard against all treacheries.’ \\n\\nHagen said, ‘Like you. I’m not worried so much about Ac \\nreal evidence as Ac evidence Aey will manufacture. Also some \\npolice friend may kill Michael after he’s arrested. They may \\nkill him in his cell or have one of Ac prisoners do it. As I see \\nit, we can’t even afford to have him arrested or accused.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone sighed. ‘1 know, I know. That’s Ae difficulty. \\nBut we can’t take too long. There arc troubles in Sicily. The \\nyoung fellows over Acre don’t listen to their elders any more \\nftoda lot of the men deported fiDom America are just too mudi \\n\\n\\n\\nfor the old-fashioned Dons to handle. Michael could get \\ncaught in between. I’ve taken some precautions against that \\nand he’s still got a good cover but that cover won’t last for \\never. That’s one of the reasons I had to make the peace. \\nBarzini has friends in Sicily and they were beginning to sniff \\nMichael’s trail. That gives you one of the answers to your \\nriddle. I had to make the peace to insure my son’s safety. \\nThere was nothing ebe to do.’ \\n\\nHagen didn’t bother asking the Don how he had got this \\ninformation. He was not even surprised, and it was true that \\nthis solved part of the riddle. *When I meet with Tattaglia’s \\npeople to firm up the detaib, should I insist that all his drug \\nmiddlemen be clean? The judges will be a little skittish about \\ngiving light sentences to a man with a record.’ \\n\\nDon Corleone shrugged. ‘They should be smart enough to \\nfigure that out themselves. Mention it, don’t insist. We’ll do \\nour best but if they use a real snowbird and he gets caught, we \\nwon’t lift a finger. We’ll just tell them nothing can be done. But \\nBarzini is a man who will know that without being told. You \\nnotice how he never committed himself in this affair. One \\nmight never have known he was in any way concerned. That \\nis a man who doesn’t get caught on the losing side.’ \\n\\nHagen was startled, ‘You mean he was behind SoUozzo and \\nTattaglia all the time?’ \\n\\nDon Corleone sighed, ‘Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never \\nhave outfought Santino. That’s why I don’t have to know \\nabout what happened. It’s enough to know that Barzini had a \\nhand in it.’ \\n\\nHagen let this sink in. The Don was giving him clues but \\nthere was something very important left put. Hagen knew what \\nit was but he knew it was not his place to ask. He said good- \\nnight and turned to go. The Don had a last word for him. \\n\\n‘Remember, use all your wits for a pbn to bring Michael \\nhome,’ the Don said. ‘And one other thing. Arrange with the \\ntelephone man so that every month I get a list of all the tele- \\nphone calb, made and received, by Qemenza and Tessio. \\nI suspect them of nothing. I would swear they would never \\nbetray me. But there’s no harm in knowing any little thing \\nthat may help us before the event.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nHagen nodded and went out. He wondered if the Don was \\nkeeping a check on him also in some way and then was ashamed \\nof his suspicion. But now he was sure that in the subtle and \\ncomplex mind of the Godfather a far-ranging plan of action \\nwas being initiated that made the day’s happenings no mote \\nthan a tactical retreat. And there was that one dark fact that no \\none mentioned, that he himself had not dared to ask, that Don \\nCorleone ignored. All pointed to a day of reckoning in the \\nfuture. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE \\n\\nBut it was to be nearly another year before Don Corleone \\ncould arrange for his son Michael co be smuggled back into the \\nUnited States. During that time the whole Family racked their \\nbrains for suitable schemes. Even Carlo Rizzi was listened to \\nnow that he was living in the mall with Connie. (During that \\ntime they had a second child, a boy.) But none of the schemes \\nmet with the Don’s approval. \\n\\nFinally it was the Bocchicchio Family who through a mis- \\nfortune of its own solved the problem. There was one Boc- \\nchicchio, a young cousin of no more than twenty-five years of \\nage, named Felix, who was born in America and with more \\nbrains than anyone in the clan had ever had before. He had \\nrefused to be drawn into the Family garbage hauling business \\nand married a nice American girl of English stock to further \\nhis split from the clan. He went to school at night, to become a \\nlawyer, and worked during the day as a civil service post office \\nclerk. During that time he had three children but his wife was \\na prudent manager and they lived on his salary until he got his \\nlaw degree. \\n\\nNow Felix Bocchicchio, like many young men, thought that \\nhaving struggled to complete his education and master the \\ntools of his profession, his virtue would automatically be re- \\nwarded and he would earn a decent living. This proved not to \\nbe the case. Still proud, he refused all help from his clan. But \\n\\n\\n\\na lawyer friend of his, a young man well connected and with a \\nbudding career in a big law firm, talked Felix into doing him \\na little favour. It was very complicated, seemingly legal, and \\nhad to do with a bankruptcy fraud. It was a million-to-onc \\nshot against its being found out. Felix Bocchicchio took the \\nchance. Since the fraud involved using the legal skills he had \\nlearned in a university, it seemed not so reprehensible, and, in \\nan odd way, not even criminal. \\n\\nTo make a foolish story short, the fraud was discovered. \\nThe lawyer friend refused to help Felix in any manner, \\'re- \\nfused to even answer his telephone calls. The two principals \\nin the fraud, shrewd middle-aged businessmen who furiously \\nblamed Felix Bocchicchlo’s legal clumsiness for the plan going \\nawry, pleaded guilty and cooperated with the state, naming \\nFelix Bocchicchio as the ringleader of the fraud and claiming \\nhe had used threats of violence to control their business and \\nforce them to cooperate with nim in his fraudulent schemes. \\nTestimony was given that linked Felix with uncles and cousins \\nin the Bocchicchio clan who had criminal records for strong- \\narm, and this evidence was damning. The two businessmen got \\noff with suspended sentences. Felix Bocchicchio was given a \\nsentence of one to five years smd served three of them. The \\nclan did not ask help from any of the Families or Don Corleone \\nbecause Felix had refused to ask their help and had to be \\ntaught a lesson: that mercy comes only from the Family, that \\nthe Family is more loyal and more to be trusted than society. \\n\\nIn any case, Felix Bocchicchio was released from prison \\nafter serving three years, went home and kissed his wife and \\nthree children and lived peacefully for a year, and then showed \\nthat, he was of the Bocchicchio clan after all. Without any \\nattempt to conceal his guilt, he procured a weapon, a pistol, \\nand shot his lawyer friend to death. He then searched out the \\ntwo businessmen and calmly shot them both through the head \\nas they came out of a luncheonette. He left the bodies lying in \\nthe street and went into the luncheonette and ordered a cup of \\ncoffee which he drank while he waited for the police to come \\nand arrest him. \\n\\nHis trial was swiff: and his Judgement merciless. A member \\nof the ortminal underworld had add-Uoadedly nrardered state \\n\\n\\n\\nwknetict who had tent him to the pcison he richly deserved. \\nIt was a flagrant flouting of society and for once the public, \\nthe press, the structure of society and even soft-headed and \\nsoft-hearted humanitarians were united in their desire to see \\nFelix Bocchicchio in the electric chair. The governor of the \\nstate would no more grant him clemency than the officials of \\nthe pound spare a mad dog, which was the phrase of one of the \\ngovernor’s closest political akles. The Bocchicchio clan of \\ncourse would spend whatever money was needed for appeals to \\nhigher courts, ^ey were proud of him now, but the conclusion \\nwas certain. After the legal folderol, which might take a little \\ntime, Felix Bocchicchio would die in the electric chair. \\n\\nIt was Hagen who brought this case to the attention of the \\nDon at the request of one of the Bocchicchios who hoped that \\nsomething could be done for the young man. Don Corleone \\ncurtly refused. He was not a magician. People asked him the \\nimpossible. But the next day the Don call^ Hagen into his \\nofHce and had him go over the case in the most intimate detail. \\nWhen Hagen was finished, Don Corleone told him to summon \\nthe head of the Bocchicchio clan to the mall for a meeting. \\n\\nWhat happened next had the simplicity of genius. Don Cor- \\nleone guaranteed to the head of the Bocchicchio clan that the \\nwife and children of Felix Bocchicchio would be rewarded \\nwith a handsome pension. The money for this would be \\nhanded over to the Bocchicchio clan immediately. In turn, \\nFelix must confess to the murder of Sollozzo and the police \\ncaptain McQuskey. \\n\\nThere were many details to be arranged. Felix Bocchicchio \\nwould have to confess convincingly, that is^ he would have to \\nknow some of the true details to confess to. Also, he must \\nimplicate the police captain in narcotics. Then the waiter at the \\nLuna Restaurant must be persuaded to identify Felix Boc- \\nchicchio as the murderer. This would take some courage, as \\nthe description would change radically, Felix Bocchicchio \\nbeing much shorter and heavier. But Don G^rleone would \\nattend to that. Also since the condemned man had been a \\ngreat believer in higher education and a college graduate he \\nwould want his children to go to college. And so a sum of \\nmoti^ would have to be paid by Don Codeone that would \\n\\n\\n\\ntake care of the children’s college. Then the Bocchicchio dan \\nhad to be reassured that there was no hope for demency on \\nthe original murders. The new confession of course would \\nseal the man’s already almost certain doom. \\n\\nEverything was arranged, the money paid and suitable con- \\ntact made with the condemned man so that he could be in- \\nstructed and advised. Finally the plan was sprung and the \\nconfession made headlines inwall the newspapers. The whole \\nthing was a huge success. But Don Corleonc, cautious as \\nalways, waited until Felix Bocchicchio was actually executed \\nfour months later before finally giving the command that \\nMichael Corleone could return home. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO \\n\\nLucy Mancini, a year after Sonny’s death, still missed him \\nterribly, grieved for him more fiercely than any lover in any \\nromance. And her dreams were not the insipid dreams of a \\nschoolgirl, her longings not the longings of a devoted wife. \\nShe was not rendered desolate by the loss of her ‘life’s com- \\npanion *, or miss him because of his stalwart character. She \\nheld no fond remembrances of sentimental gifts, of girlish hero \\nworship, his smile, the amused glint of his eyes when he said \\nsomething endearing or witty. \\n\\nNo. She missed him for the more important reason that he \\nhad been the only man in the world who could make her body \\nachieve the act of love. And, in her youth and innocence, she \\nstill believed that he was the only man who could possibly do \\nso. \\n\\nNow a year later she sunned herself in the balmy Nevada air. \\nAt her feet the slender, blond young man was playing with \\nher toes. They were at the side of the hotel pool for the Sunday \\nafternoon and despite the people all around them his hand was \\nsliding up her bare thigh. \\n\\n‘Oh, Jules, stop,* Lucy said. ‘I thought doctors at least \\nweren’t as silly as other men.* \\n\\n306 \\n\\n\\n\\nJules grinned at her. *rm a Las Vegas doctor.’ He tickled \\nthe inside of her thigh and was amazed how just a little thing \\nlike that could excite her so powerfully. It showed on her hcc \\nthough she tried to bide it. She was really a very primitive, \\ninnocent girl. Then why couldn’t he make her come across? \\nHe had to figure that one out and never mind the crap about \\na lost love that could never be replaced. This was living tissue \\nhere under his hand and living tissue required other living \\ntissue. Dr Jules Segal decided he would make the big push \\ntonight at his apartment. He’d wanted to make her come \\nacross without any trickery but if trickery there had to be, he \\nwas the man for it. All in the interests of science of course. \\nAnd, besides, this poor kid was dying for it. \\n\\n‘Jules, stop, please stop,’ Lucy said. Her voice was trem- \\nbling. \\n\\nJidcs was immediately contrite. ‘OK, honey,’ he said. He \\nput his head in her lap and using her soft thighs as a pillow, \\nhe took a little nap. He was amused at her squirming, the heat \\nthat registered from her loins and when she put her hand on \\nhis head to smooth his hair, he grasped her wrist playfully and \\nheld it loverlike but really to feel her pulse. It was galloping. \\nHe’d get her tonight and he’d solve the mystery, what the hell \\nevei it was. Fully confident. Dr Jules Segal fell asleep. \\n\\nLucy watched the people around the pool. She could never \\nhave imagined her life would change so in less than two years. \\nShe never regretted her ‘foolishness’ at Connie Corleone’s \\nwedding. It was the most wonderful thing that had ever hap- \\npened to her and she lived it over and over again in her \\ndreams. As she lived over and over again the months that \\nfollowed. \\n\\nSonny had visited her once a week, sometimes more, never \\nless. The days before she saw him again her body was in tor- \\nment. Their passion for each other was of the most elementary \\nkind, undiluted by poetry or any form of intellectualism. It was \\nlove of the coarsest nature, a fieshy love, a love of tissue for \\nopposing tissue. \\n\\nWhen Sonny called to tell her he was coming she made \\ncertain there was enough liquor in the apartment and enough \\nfood for supper and breakfast because usually he would not \\n\\n307 \\n\\n\\n\\nleave untU late the next morning. He wanted his fill of her as \\nshe wanted her fill of him. He had his own key and when he \\ncame in the door she would fiy into his massive arms. They \\nwould both be brutally direct, brutally primitive. During their \\nfirst kiss they would be fumbling at each other’s clothing and \\nhe would be lifting her in the air, and she would be wrapping \\nher legs around his huge thighs. They would be making love \\nstanding up in the foyer of her apartment as if they had to \\nrepeat their first act of love together, and then he would carry \\nher so to the bedroom. \\n\\nThey would lie in bed making love. They would live to- \\ngether in the apartment for sixteen hours, completely naked. \\nShe would cook for him, enormous meals. Sometimes he would \\nget phone calls obviously about business but she never even \\nlistened to the words. She would be too busy toying with his \\nbody, fondling it, kissing it, burying her mouth in it. Some- \\ntimes when he got up to get a drink and he walked by her, she \\ncouldn’t help reaching out to touch his naked body, hold him, \\nmake love to him as if those special parts of his body were a \\nplaything, a specially constructed, intricate but innocent toy \\nrevealing its known, but still surprising, ecstasies. At first she \\nhad been ashamed of these excesses on her part but soon saw \\nthat they pleased her lover, that her complete sensual en- \\nslavement to his body flattered him. In all this there was an \\nanimal iimoccnce. They were happy together. \\n\\nWhen Sonny’s father was gunned dowm in the street, she \\nunderstood for the first time that her lover might be in danger. \\nAlone in her apartment, she did not weep, she wailed aloud, \\nan animal wailing. When Sonny did not come to see her for \\nalmost three weeks she subsisted on sleeping pills, liquor, and \\nher oVn anguish. The pain she felt was physical pain, her body \\nached. When he finally did come she held on to his body at \\nalmost every moment. After that he came at least once a week \\nuntil he was killed. \\n\\nShe learned of his death through the newspaper accounts \\nand that very same night she took a massive overdose of \\nsleeping pills. For some reason, instead of killing, the pills \\nmai^ her so ill that she staggered out into the 1^ of her \\napartment and coPapsed in inmt of the devator door where \\n\\n\\n\\nshe was found and taken to the hospital. Her relationship to \\nSonny was not generally known so her case received only a \\nfew inches in the tabloid newspapers. \\n\\nIt was while she was in the hospital that Tom Hagen came \\nto see her and console her. It was Tom Hagen who arranged a \\njob for her in Las Vegas working in the hotel run by Sonny’s \\nbrother Freddie. It was Tom Hagen who told her that she \\nwould receive an annuity from the Corlcone Family, that \\nSonny had made provisions for her. He had asked her if she \\nwas pregnant, as if that were the reason for her taking the \\npills and she had told him no. He asked her if Sonny had come \\nto see her that fatal night or had called that he would come \\nto see her and she told him no, that Sonny had not called. \\nThat she was always home waiting for him when she finished \\nworking. And she had told Hagen the truth. *He’s the only \\nman I could ever love,* she said. *l can’t love anybody else.’ \\nShe saw him smile a little but he also looked surprised. ‘Do \\nyou find that so unbelievable?’ she asked. ‘Wasn’t he the one \\nwho brought you home when you were a kid?’ \\n\\n‘ He was a didcrent person,’ Hagen said, ‘ be grew up to be a \\ndifferent kind of man.’ \\n\\n‘ Not to me,’ Lucy said. ‘ Maybe to everybody else, but not to \\nme.\\' She was still too weak to explain bow Sonny had never \\nbeen anything but gentle with her. He’d never been angry with \\nher, never even irritable or nervous. \\n\\nHagen made all the arrangements for her to move to Las \\nVegas. A rented apartment was waiting, he took her to the air- \\nport himself and be made her promise that if she ever felt \\nlonely or if things didn’t go right, she would call him and he \\nwould help her in any way he could. \\n\\nBefore she got on the plane she asked him hesitantly, ‘Docs \\nSonny’s father know what you’re doing?’ \\n\\nHagen smiled, ‘I’m acting for him as well as myself. He’s \\nold-fashioned in these things and he would never go against \\nthe legal wife of his son. But he feels that you were just a \\nyoung girl and Sonny should have known better. And your \\ntaking those pills shook everybody up.’ He didn’t explain \\nhow incredible it was to a man like the Don that any person \\nshould try suicide. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow, after nearly eighteen months in Las Vegas, she was \\nsurprised to find herself almost happy. Some nights she \\ndreamed about Sonny and lying awake before dawn continued \\nher dream with her own caresses until she could sleep again. \\nShe had not had a man since. But the life in Vegas agreed with \\nher. She went swimming in the hotel pools, sailed on Lake \\nMead, and drove through the desert on her day off. She be- \\ncame thinner and this improved her figure. She was still \\nvoluptuous but more in the American than the old Italian \\nstyle. She w^^tked in the public relations section of the hotel \\nas a receptionist and had nothing to do with Freddie though \\nwhen he saw her he would stop and chat a little. She was sur- \\nprised at the change in Freddie. He had become a ladies’ man, \\ndressed beautifully, and seemed to have a real ffair for running \\na gambling resort. He controlled the hotel side, something \\nnot usually done by casino owners. With the long, very hot \\nsummer seasons, or perhaps his more active sex life, he too \\nhad become thinner and Hollywood tailoring made him look \\nalmost debonair in a deadly sort of way. \\n\\nIt was after six months that Tom Hagen came out to see how \\nshe was doing. She had been receiving a cheque for six hundred \\ndollars a month, every month, in addition to her salary. Hagen \\nexplained that this money had to be shown as coming from \\nsome place and asked her to sign complete powers of attorney \\nso that he could channel the money properly. He also told her \\nthat as a matter of form she would be listed as owner of five \\n\\'points’ in the hotel in which she worked. She would have to \\ngo through all the legal formalities required by the Nevada\\' \\nlaws but everything would be taken care of for her and her \\nown personal inconvenience would be at a minimum. How- \\never she was not to discuss this arrangement with anyone \\nwithout his consent. She would be protected legally in every \\nway and her money every month would be assured. If the \\nauthorities or any law-enforcement agencies ever questioned \\nher, she was to simply refer them to her lawyer and she would \\nnot be bothered any further. \\n\\nLucy agreed. She understood what was happening but had \\nno objections to how she was being used. It seemed a reason- \\nable favour. But when Hagen asked her to keep her eyes open \\n\\n\\n510 \\n\\n\\n\\naround the hotel, keep an eye on Freddie and on Freddie’s \\nboss, the man who owned and operated the hotel, as a major \\nstockholder, she said to him, ‘Oh, Tom, you don’t want me \\nto spy on FreddieV \\n\\nHagen smiled. ‘His father worries about Freddie. He’s in \\nfast company with Moe Greene and we just want to make sure \\nhe doesn’t get into any trouble.’ He didn’t bother to explain \\nto her that the Don had backed the building of this hotel in \\nthe desert of Las Vegas not only to supply a haven for his son, \\nbut to get a foot in the door for bigger operations. \\n\\nIt was shortly after this interview that Dr Jules Segal came \\nto work as the hotel house physician. He was very thin, very \\nhandsome and charming and seemed very young to be a \\ndoctor, at least to Lucy, She met him when a lump grew above \\nher wrist on her forearm. She worried about it for a few days, \\nthen one morning went to the doctor’s suite of offices in the \\nhotel. Two of the show girls from the chorus line were in the \\nwaiting room, gossiping with each other. They had the blonde \\npeach-coloured prettiness Lucy always envied. They looked \\nangelic. But one of the girls was saying, ‘I swear if I have \\nanother dose I’m giving up dancing.’ \\n\\nWhen Dr Jules Segal opened his office door to motion one \\nof the show girls inside, Lucy was tempted to leave, and if it \\nhad been something more personal and serious she would \\nhave. Dr Segal was wearing slacks and an open shirt. The \\nhorn-rimmed glasses helped and his quiet reserved manner, \\nbut the impression he gave was an informal one, and like \\nmany basically old-fashioned people, Lucy didn’t believe that \\nmedicine and informality mixed. \\n\\nWhen she finally got into his office there was something so \\nreassuring in his manner that all her misgivings fled. He spoke \\nhardly at all and yet he was not brusque, and he took his time. \\nWhen she asked him what the lump was he patiently explained \\nthat it was a quite common fibrous growth that could in no \\nway be malignant or a cause for serious concern. He picked \\nup a heavy medical book and said, ‘Hold out your arm.’ \\n\\nShe held out her arm tentatively. He smiled at her for the \\nfirst time. ‘I’m going to cheat myself out of a surgical fee,* he \\nsaid. ‘I’ll just smash it with this book and it will flatten out. It \\n\\n\\n3 ” \\n\\n\\n\\nmay pop up*again but if I remove it surgically, you’ll be out of \\nmoney and have to wear bandages and all that. OK?’ \\n\\nShe smiled at him. For some reason she had an absolute \\ntrust in him. ‘OK,’ she said. In the next instant she let out a \\nyell as be brought down the heavy medical volume on her \\nforearm. The lump had flattened out, almost. \\n\\n‘Did it hurt that much?’ he asked. \\n\\n‘No,’ she said. She watched him completing her case history \\ncatd. ‘Is that all?’ \\n\\nHe nodded, not paying any more attention to hex. She left. \\n\\nA week later he saw her in the coffee shop and sat next to her \\nat the counter. ‘How’s the arm?’ he asked. \\n\\nShe smiled at him. ‘Fine,* she said. ‘You’re pretty unortho- \\ndox but you’re pretty good.’ \\n\\nHe grinned at her. ‘You don’t know how unorthodox I am. \\nAnd I didn’t know how rich you were. The Vegas Sm just \\npublished the list of point owners in the hotel and Lucy \\nMancini has a big ten points. I could have made a fortune on \\nthat little bump.’ \\n\\nShe didn’t answer him, suddenly reminded of Hagen’s \\nwarnings. He grinned again. ‘Don’t worry, I know the score, \\nyou’re just one of the dummies, Vegas is full of them. How \\nabout seeing one of the shows with me tonight and I’ll even \\nbuy you some roulette chips.’ \\n\\nShe was a little doubtful. He urged her. Finally she said, ‘I’d \\nlike to come but I’m afraid you might be disappointed by how \\nthe night ends. I’m not really a swinger like most of the girls \\nhere in Vegas.’ \\n\\n‘That’s why I asked you,’ Jules said cheerfully. ‘I’ve pre- \\nscribed a night’s rest for myself.’ \\n\\nLucy smiled at him and said a little sadly, ‘ Is it that obvious? ’ \\nHe shook his head and she said, *OK, supper then, but I’ll \\nbuy my own roulette chips.* \\n\\nThey went to the supper show and Jules kept her amused by \\ndescribing different types of bare thighs and breasts in medical \\nterms ; but without sneering, all in good humour. Afterwards \\nthey played roulette together at the same wheel and won over \\na hundred dollars. Still later they drove up to Boulder Dam in \\nthe moonlight and he tried to make love to her but when she \\n\\n\\n\\nresisted after a few kisses he knew she really meant no and \\nstopped. Again he took his defeat with great good humour. \\n‘1 told you 1 wouldn’t,’ Luq^ said with half-guilty reproach. \\n\\n‘You would have been aw^Uy insulted if I didn’t even try,* \\nJules said. And she had to laugh because it was true. \\n\\nThe next few months they became best friends. It wasn’t love \\nbecause they didn’t make love, Lucy wouldn’t let him. She \\ncould see he was puzzled by her refusal but not hurt the way \\nmost men would be and that made her trust him even more. \\nShe found out that beneath his professional doctor’s exterior \\nhe was wildly fiin-loving and reckless. On weekends he drove \\na souped-up MG in the California races. When he took a \\nvacation he went down into the interior of Mexico, the real \\nwild coimtry, he told her, where strangers were murdered \\nfor their shoes and life was as primitive as a thousand years \\nago. Quite accidentally she learned that he was a surgeon and \\nhad been connected with a famous hospital in New York. \\n\\nAll this made her more puzzled than ever at his having taken \\nthe job at the hotel. When she asked him about it, Jules said, \\n‘You tell me your dark secret and I’ll tell you mine.’ \\n\\nShe blushed and let the matter drop. Jules didn’t pursue it \\neither and their relationship continued, a warm friendship that \\nshe counted on more than she realized. \\n\\nNow, sitting at the side of the pool with Jules’ blond head in \\nher lap, she felt an overwhelming tenderness for him. Her \\nloins ached and without realizing it her fingers sensuously \\nstroked the skin of his neck. He seemed to be sleeping, not \\nnoticing, and she became excited just by the feel of him against \\nher. Suddenly he raised his head from her lap and stood up. \\nHe took her by the hand and led her over the grass on to the \\ncement walk. She followed him dutifully even when he led her \\ninto one of the cottages that held his private apartment. When \\nthey were inside he fixed them both big drinks. After the \\nblazing sun and her own sensuous thoughts the drink went to \\nher head and made her dizzy. Then Jules had his arms around \\nher and their bodies, naked except for scanty bathing suite, \\nwere pressed against each other. Lucy was murmuring, ‘ Don’t,’ \\nbut there was no conviction in her voice and Jules paid no \\n\\n\\n\\nattention to her. He quickly stripped her bathing bra off so \\nthat he could fondle her heavy breasts, kissed them and then \\nstripped off her bathing trunks and as he did so kept kissing \\nher body, her rounded belly and the insides of her thighs. He \\nstood up, struggling out of his own bathing shorts and em- \\nbracing her, and then, naked in each other’s arms, they were \\nlying on his bed and she could feel him entering her and it was \\nenough, just the slight touch, for her to reach her climax and \\nthen in the second afterwards she could read in the motions of \\nhis body, his surprise. She felt the overwhelming shame she \\nhad felt before she knew Sonny, but Jules was twisting her \\nbody over the edge of the bed, positioning her legs a certain \\nway and she let him control her limbs and her body, and then \\nhe was entering her again and kissing her and this time she \\ncould feci him but more important she could tell that he was \\nfeeling something too and coming to his climax. \\n\\nWhen he rolled off her body, Lucy huddled into one corner \\nof the bed and began to cry. She felt so ashamed. And then \\nshe was shockingly surprised to hear Jules laugh softly and \\nsay, ‘You poor benighted Eyc-talian girl, so that’s why you \\nkept refusing me all these months? You dope.’ He said ‘you \\ndope ’ with such friendly affection that she turned towards him \\nand he took her naked body against his saying, ‘You are \\nmedieval, you are positively medieval.’ But the voice was \\nsoothingly comforting as she continued to weep. \\n\\nJules lit a cigarette and put it in her mouth so that she \\nchoked on the smoke and had to stop crying. ‘Now listen to \\nme,’ he said, ‘if you had had a decent modern raising with a \\nfamily culture that was part of the twentieth century your \\nproblem would have been solved years ago. Now let me tell \\nyou what your problem is ; it’s not the equivalent of being ugly, \\nof having bad skin and squinty eyes that facial surgery really \\ndoesn’t solve. Your problem is like having a wart or a mole \\non your chin, or an improperly formed car. Stop thinking of \\nit in sexual terms. Stop thinking in your head that you have a \\nbig box no man can love because it won’t give his penis the \\nnecessary friction. What you have is a pelvic malformation and \\nwhat we surgeons call a weakening of the pelvic floor. It \\nusually comes after child-bearing but it can be simply bad bone \\n\\n\\n\\nstructure. It’s a common condition and many women live a \\nlife of misery because of it when a simple operation could fix \\nthem up. Some women even commit suicide because of it. But \\nI never figured you for that condition because you have such a \\nbeautiful body. I thought it was psychological, since I know \\nyour story, you told it to me often enough, you and Sonny. \\nBut let me give you a thorough physical examination and I \\ncan tell you just exactly how much work will have to be done. \\nNow go in and take a shower.’ \\n\\nLucy went in and took her shower. Patiently and over her \\nprotests, Jules made her lie on the bed, legs spread apart. He \\nhad an extra doctor’s bag in his apartment and it was open. He \\nalso had a small glass-topped table by the bed which held some \\nother instruments. He was all business now, examining her, \\nsticking his fingers inside her and moving them around. She \\nwas beginning to feel humiliated when he kissed her on the \\nnavel and said, almost absentmindedly, ‘First time I’ve en- \\njoyed my work.’ Then he flipped her over and thrust a finger \\nin her rectum, feeling around, but his other hand was stroking \\nher neck affectionately. When he was finished he turned her \\nright side up again, kissed her tenderly on the mouth and said, \\n‘Baby, I’m going to build you a whole new thing down there, \\nand then I’ll try it out personally. It will be a medical first. I’ll \\nbe able to write a paper on it for the official journals.’ \\n\\nJules did everything with such good-humoured affection, he \\nso obviously cared for her, that Lucy got over her shame and \\nembarrassment. He even had the medical textbook down off \\nits shelf to show her a case like her own and the surgical pro- \\ncedure to correct it. She found herself quite interested. \\n\\n‘It’s a health thing too,’ Jules said. ‘If you don’t get it \\ncorrected you’re going to have a hell of a lot of trouble later \\non with your whole plumbing system. The structure becomes \\nprogressively weaker unless it’s corrected by surgery. It’s a \\ndamn shame that old-fashioned prudery keeps a lot of doc- \\ntors from properly diagnosing and correcting the situation, \\nand a lot of women from complaining about it.’ \\n\\n‘Don’t talk about it, please don’t talk about it,’ Lucy said. \\n\\nHe could see that she was still to some extent ashamed of \\nher secret, embarrassed by her ‘ugly defect’. Though to his \\n\\n\\n\\nmedically trained mind this seemed the height of silliness, he \\nwas sensitive enough to identify with her. It also put him on \\nthe right track to making her feel better. \\n\\n* OK, I know your secret so now I’ll tell you mine,’ he said. \\n\\n‘ You always ask me what I’m doing here in this town, one of \\nthe youngest and most brilliant surgeons in the East.’ He was \\nmocking some newspaper reports about himself. *The truth \\nis that I’m an abortionist, which in itself is not so bad, so is \\nhalf the medical profession; but 1 got caught. I had a friend, \\na doctor named Kennedy, we interned together, and he’s a \\nreally straight guy but he said he’d help me. I understand Tom \\nHagen had told him if he ever needed help on anything the \\nCorleone Family was indebted to him. So he spoke to Hagen. \\nThe nact thing I know the charges were dropped, but the \\nMedical Association and the Eastern establishment had me \\nblacklisted. So the Corleone Family got me this job out here. \\nI make a good living. I do a job ^at has to be done. These \\nshow girls are always getting knocked up and aborting them \\nis the easiest thing in the world if they come to me right away. \\n1 curette ’em like you scrape a frying pan. Freddie Corleone is \\na real terror. By my count he’s knocked up fifteen girls while \\nI’ve been here. I’ve seriously considered giving him a fathet- \\nto-fsther talk about sex. Especially since I’ve had to treat him \\nthree times for clap and once for syphilis. Freddie is the original \\nbareback rider.’ \\n\\nJules stopped talking. He had been deliberately indiscreet, \\nsomething he never did, so that Lucy would know that other \\npeople, including someone she knew and feared a little like \\nFreddie Corleone, also had shameful secrets. \\n\\n* Think of it as a piece of elastic in your body that has lost \\nits. elasticity,’ Jules said. *By cutting out a piece, you make it \\ntighter, snappier.’ \\n\\n‘I’ll think about it,’ Lucy said, but she was sure she was \\ngoing to go through with it, she trusted Jules absolutely. Then \\nshe thought of something else. ‘How much will it cost?’ \\n\\nJules frowned. *I haven’t the facilities here for surgery like \\nthat and I’m not the expert at it. But I have a friend in Los \\nAngeles who’s the best in the field and has facilities at the best \\nhospital. In fact he tightens up all the movie stars, when those \\n\\n5t6 \\n\\n\\n\\ndames fifid out that getting thek faces and breasts lifted isn’t \\nthe whole answer to making a man love them. He owes me a \\nfew favours so it won’t cost anything. 1 do his abortions for \\nhim. Listen, if it weren’t unethical I’d tell you the names of \\nsome of the movie sex queens who have had the operation.’ \\n\\nShe was immediately curious. * Oh, come on, tell me,’ she \\nsaid. ‘Come on.’ It would be a delicious piece of gossip and \\none of the things about Jules was that she could show her \\nfeminine love of gossip without him making fun of it. \\n\\n‘ I’ll tell you if you have dinner with me and spend the night \\nwith me,* Jules said. ‘We have a lot of lost time to make up \\nfor because of ydur silliness.’ \\n\\nLucy felt an overwhelming affection to him for being so \\nkind and she was able to say, ‘You don’t have to sleep with \\nme, you know you won’t enjoy it the way 1 am now.* \\n\\nJules burst out laughing. ‘You dope, you incredible dope. \\nDidn’t you ever hear of any other way of making love, far \\nmore ancient, far mote civilized. Are you really that innocent ? * \\n\\n*Oh that,’ she said. \\n\\n‘Oh that,’ he mimicked her. ‘Nice girls don’t do that, manly \\nmen don’t do that. Even in the year 1948. Well, baby, 1 can \\ntake you to the house of a little old lady right here in Las Vegas \\nwho was the youngest madam of the most popular whorehouse \\nin the wild west days, back in 1880 , 1 think it was. She likes to \\ntalk about the old days. You know what she told me? That \\nthose gunslingers, those manly, virile, straight-shoodng cow- \\nboys would always ask the girls for a “French”, what we \\ndoctors call fellatio, what you call “oh that”. Did you ever \\nthink of doing “oh that” with yoUr beloved Sonny?’ \\n\\nFor the first time she truly surprised him. She turned on him \\nwith what he could think of only as a Mona Lisa smile (his \\nscientific mind immediately darting off on a tangent, could this \\nbe the solving of that centuries-old mystery?) and said quietly, \\n‘I did everything with Sonny.’ It was the first time she had \\never admitted anything like that to anyone. \\n\\nTwo weeks later Jules Segal stood in the operating room of \\nthe Los Angeles hospital and watched his friend Dr Frederick \\nKelloer perform the q^edalty. Before Lacy was put under \\nanarstheria, J ulfs le a n ed over and wh ii prred, ‘I told him you \\n\\n\\n3n \\n\\n\\n\\nwere my special girl so he*s going to pat in some real tight \\nwalls.’ But the preliminary pill had already made her dopey \\nand she didn’t laugh or smile. His teasing remark did take \\naway some of the terror of the operation. \\n\\nDr Kellner made his indsion with the confidence of a pool \\nshark making an easy shot. The technique of any operation \\nto strengthen the pelvic fioor required the accomplishment of \\ntwo objectives. The musculofibrous pelvis sling had to be \\nshortened so that the slack was taken up. And of course the \\nvaginal opening, the weak spot itself in the pdvic floor, had \\nto be brought forward, brought under the pubic arch and so \\nrelieved from the line of direct pressure above. Repairing the \\npelvic sling was called perineorrhaphy. Suturing the vaginal \\nwall was called colporrhaphy. \\n\\nJules saw that Dr Kellner was working carefiiUy now, the \\nbig danger in the cutting was going too deep and hitting the \\nrectum. It was a fairly uncomplicated case, Jules had studied \\nall the X-rays and tests. Nothing should go wrong except that \\nin surgery something could always go wrong. \\n\\nKellner was working on the diaphragm sling, the T forceps \\nhdd the vaginal flap, and exposing the ani musde and the \\nfasd which formed its sheath. Kellner’s gauze-covered fingers \\nwere pushing aside loose connective tissue. Jules kept his eyes \\non the vaginal wall for the appearance of the veins, the telltale \\ndanger signal of injuring the rectum. But old Kdlner knew his \\nstuff. He was building a new snatch as easily as a carpenter \\nnails together two-by-four studs. \\n\\nKellner was trimming away the excess vaginal wall using the \\nfastening-down stitch to close the ‘bite’ taken out of the tissue \\nof the redundant angle, insuring that no troublesome projec- \\ntiohs would form. Kellner was trying to insert three fingers \\ninto the narrowed opening of the lumen, then two. He just \\nmanaged to get two fingers in, probing deeply and for a \\nmoment he looked up at Jules and his china-blue eyes over \\nthe gauze mask twinkled as though asking if that was narrow \\nenough. Then he. was busy again with his sutures. \\n\\nIt was all over. They wheeled Lucy out to the recovery room \\nand Jules talked to Kellner. Kellner was cheerful, the best sign \\nthat everything had gone well. ‘No complications at all, my \\n\\n518 \\n\\n\\n\\nboy,* he told Jules. ‘Nothing growing in there, very simple \\ncase. She has wonderful body tone, unusual in these cases and \\nnow she’s in first-class shape for fun and games. I envy you, \\nmy boy. Of course you’ll have to wait a little while but then 1 \\nguarantee you’ll like my work.’ \\n\\nJules laughed. ‘You’re a true Pygmalion, Doctor. Really, \\nyou were marvellous.’ \\n\\nDr Kellner grunted. ‘That’s all child’s play, like your abor- \\ntions. If society would only be realistic, people like you and I, \\nreally talented people, could do important work and leave this \\nstuff for the hacks. By the way. I’ll be sending you a girl next \\nweek, a very nice girl, they seem to be the ones who always \\nget in trouble. That will make us all square for this job today.* \\n\\nJules shook his hand. ‘ Thanks, Doctor. Come out yourself \\nsometime and I’ll see that you get all the courtesies of the \\nhouse.’ \\n\\nKellner gave him a wry smile. ‘ I gamble every day, I don’t \\nneed your roulette wheels and crap tables. I knock heads with \\nfate too often as it is. You’re going to waste out there, Jules. \\nAnother couple of years and you can forget about serious \\nsurgery. You won’t be up to it.’ He turned away. \\n\\nJules knew it was not meant as a reproach but as a warning. \\nY et it took the heart out of him anyway. Since Lucy wouldn’t be \\nout of the recovery room for at least twelve hours, he went out \\non the town and got drunk. Part of the getting drunk was his feel- \\ning of relief that everything had worked out so well with Lucy. \\n\\nThe next morning when he went to the hospital to visit her \\nhe was surprised to find two men at her bedside and flowers \\naU over the room. Lucy was propped up on pillows, her face \\nradiant. Jules was surprised because Lucy had broken with her \\nfamily and had told him not to notify them unless something \\nwent wrong. Of course Freddie Corleone knew she was in the \\nhospital for a minor operation; that had been necessary so that \\nthey both could get time off, and Freddie had told Jules that \\nthe hotel would pick up all the bills for Lucy. \\n\\nLucy was introducing them and one of the men Jules recog- \\nniaed instantly. The famous Johnny Fontane. The other was a \\nbig, muscular, snotty-looking Italian guy whose name was \\n\\n\\n519 \\n\\n\\n\\nNino Valenti. They both shook hands with Jules and then \\npaid no further attention to him. They were kidding Lucy, \\ntalking about the old neighbourhood in New York, about \\npeople and events Jules had no way of sharing. So he said to \\nLucy, *1*11 drop by later, I have to see Dr Kellner anyway/ \\n\\nBut Johnny Fontane was turning the charm on him. ‘Hey, \\nbuddy, we have to leave ourselves, you keep Lucy company. \\nTake good care of her. Doc/ Jules noticed a peculiar hoarse- \\nness in Johnny Fontane’s voice and remembered suddenly \\nthat the man hadn*t sung in public for over a year now, that \\nhe had won the Academy Award for his acting. Could the \\nman’s voice have changed so late in life and the papers keeping \\nit a secret, everybody keeping it a secret? Jules loved inside \\ngossip and he kept listening to Fontane’s voice in an attempt to \\ndiagnose the trouble. It could be simple strain, or too much \\nbooze and cigarettes or even too much women. The voice had \\nan ugly timbre to it, he could never be called the sweet crooner \\nany more. \\n\\n*You sound like you have a cold,’ Jules said to Johnny \\nFontane. \\n\\nFontane said politely, *Ju8t strain, I tried to sing last night. \\n1 gviess 1 just can’t accept the fact that my voice changed, get- \\nting old you know.’ He gave Jules a what-the-hell grin. \\n\\nJules said casually, * Didn’t you get a doctor to look at it? \\nMaybe it’s something that can be fixed.’ \\n\\nFontane was not so charming now. He gave Jules a long \\ncool look, * That’s the first thing I did nearly two years ago. \\nBest specialists. My own doctor who’s supposed to be the top \\nguy out here in California. They told me to get a lot of rest. \\nNothing wrong, just getting older. A man’s voice changes \\nwhen he gets older.’ \\n\\nFontane ignored him after that, paying attention to Lucy, \\ncharming her as he charmed all women. Jules kept listening \\nto the voice. There had to be a growth on those vocal \\nchords. But then why the hell hadn’t the specialists spotted \\nit? Was it malignant and inoperable? Then there was other \\nstuff. \\n\\nHe interrupted Fontane to ask, * When was the last time you \\ngot examined by a specialist?’ \\n\\n\\n320 \\n\\n\\n\\nFontane was obviously irritated but trying to be polite for \\nLucy’s sake. ‘About eighteen months ago/ he said. \\n\\n‘Does your own doctor take a look once in a while?’ Jules \\nasked. \\n\\n‘Sure he does/ Johnny Fontane said irritably. ‘He gives me \\na codeine spray and checks me out. He told me it’s just my \\nvoice ageing, that all the drinking and smoking and other \\nstuff. Maybe you know more than he does?’ \\n\\nJules asked, ‘What’s his name?’ \\n\\nFontane said with just a faint flicker of pride, ‘Tucker, Dr \\nJames Tucker. Wliat do you think of him?’ \\n\\nThe name was familiar, linked to famous movie stars, \\nfemale, and to an expensive health farm. \\n\\n‘He’s a sharp dresser,’ Jules said with a grin. \\n\\nFontane was angry now. ‘You think you’re a better doctor \\nthan he is?’ \\n\\nJules laughed. ‘Are you a better singer than Carmen Lom- \\nbardo?’ He was surprised to see Nino Valenti break up in \\nlaughter, banging his head on his chair. The joke hadn’t been \\nthat good. Then on the wings of those guffaws he caught \\nthe smeU of bourbon and knew that even this early in the \\nmorning Mr Valenti, whoever the hell he was, was at least \\nhalf drunk. \\n\\nFontane was grinning at his friend. ‘Hey, you’re supposed \\nto be laughing at my jokes, no^ his.’ Meanwhile Lucy stretched \\nout her hand to Jules and drew him to her bedside. \\n\\n‘He looks like a bum but he’s a brilliant surgeon,’ Lucy told \\nthem. ‘If he says he’s better than Dr Tucker then he’s better \\nthan Dr Tucker. You listen to him, Johnny.’ \\n\\nThe nurse came in and told them they would have to leave. \\nThe resident was going to do some work on Lucy and needed \\nprivacy. Jules was amused to see Lucy turn her head away so \\nwhen Johnny Fontane and Nino Valenti kissed her they w’ould \\nhit her cheek instead of her mouth, but they seemed to expect \\nit. She let Jules kiss her on the mouth and whispered, ‘Come \\nback this afternoon, please?* He nodded. \\n\\nOut in the corridor, Valenti asked him, ‘ WTiat was the opera- \\ntion for? Anything serious?* \\n\\nJules shook his head. ‘Just a little female plumbing. \\n\\n5^1 \\n\\n\\nGod&ther n \\n\\n\\n\\nAlisolutelv routine, please belie\\\\ c me. I’m more concerned than \\nvoii arc, I hope to marry the girl/ \\n\\nThey were looking at him appraisingly so he asked, *How \\ndid you find out she was in the hospital?’ \\n\\n* TTeddie called us and asked us to look in,’ Fontane said. \\n‘Wc all grew up in the same neighbourhood. Lucy was maid \\not\\' honour when Freddie’s sLstcr got married.’ \\n\\nX)li,’ Jules said. Fie didn’t let on that he knew the -whole \\nstory, perhaps because they were so cagey about protecting \\nLucy and her afFair with Sonny. \\n\\nAs they walked down the corridor, Jules said to Fontane, ‘I \\nhave visiting doctor’s privileges here, why don’t you let me \\nhave a look at your throat?’ \\n\\nFontane shook his head. ‘I’m in a hurry.’ \\n\\nNino Valenti said, ‘That’s a million-dollar throat, he can’t \\nhave cheap doctors looking down it.’ Jules saw Valenti was \\ngrinning at him, obviously on his side. \\n\\nJules said cheerfully, ‘I’m no cheap doctor. I w\\'as the \\nbrightest young surgeon and diagnostician on the East Coast \\nuntil they got me on an abortion rap.’ \\n\\nAs he had known it would, that made them take him \\nseriously. By admitting his crime he inspired belief in his claim \\nof high competence. Valenti recovered first. ‘If Johnny can’t \\nuse you, I got a girlfriend I want you to look at, not at her \\nthroat though.’ \\n\\nI\\'ontane said to him nervously, ‘How long will you take?’ \\n\\n‘Ten minutes,’ Jules said. It was a lie but he believed in \\ntelling lies to people. Truth telling and medicine just didn’t go \\ntogether except in dire emergencies, if then. \\n\\n‘OK,* Fontane said. His voice was darker, hoarser, with \\nfright. \\n\\nJules recruited a nurse and a consulting room. It didn’t have \\neverything he needed but there was enough. In less than ten \\nminutes he knew there was a growth on the vocal chords, that \\nwas easy. Tucker, that incompetent sartorial son of a bitch of a \\nHollywood phony, should have been able to spot it. Christ, \\nmaybe the guy didn’t even have a licence and if he did it \\nshould be taken away from him. Jules didn’t pay any attention \\nto the two men now. He picked up the phone and asked for \\n\\n\\n522 \\n\\n\\n\\nthe throat man at the hospital to come down. Then he swung \\naround and said to Nino Valenti, * 1 think it might be a long \\nwait for you, you\\'d better leave.\\' \\n\\nFontane stared at him in uttet disbelief. ‘ You son of a bitchy \\nyou think you\\'re going to keep me here? You think you’re \\ngoing to fuck around with my throat ? ’ \\n\\nJules, with more pleasure than he w^ould have thought pos- \\nsible, gave it to him straight Between the eyes. ‘You can do \\nwhatever you like,\\' he said. ‘ You’ve got a growth of some sort \\non your vocal chords, in youi larynx. If you stay here the next \\nfew hours, wc can nail it down, whether it’s malignant non- \\nmalignant. We can make a decision for surgery or treatment. \\nI can give you the whole story. I can give you the name of the \\ntop specialist in America and we can have him out here on the \\nplane tonight, with your money that is, and if I think it neces- \\nsary. But you can walk out of here and see your quack buddy \\nor sweat while you decide to sec another doctor, or get \\nreferred to somebody incompetent. Then if it’s malignant and \\ngets big enough they\\'ll cut out your whole larynx or you’ll \\ndie. Or you can just sweat. Stick here with me and we can get \\nit all squared away in a few hours. You got anything more \\nimportant to do?’ \\n\\nValenti said, ‘Let’s stick around, Johnny, what the hell. I’ll \\ngo down the hall and call the studio. 1 won’t tell them any- \\nthing, just that we’re held up. Then I’ll come back here and \\nkeep you company.’ \\n\\nIt proved to be a very long afternoon but a rewarding one. \\nThe diagnosis of the staff throat man was perfectly sound as \\nfar as Jules could see after the X-rays and swab analysis. Half- \\nway through, Johnny Fontane, his mouth soaked, with iodine, \\nretching over the roll of gauze stuck in his mouth, tried to \\nquit. Nino Valenti grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed \\nhim back into the chair. When it was all over Jules grinned at \\nFontane and said, ‘Warts.\\' \\n\\nFontane didn’t grasp it. Jules said again, ‘Just some warts. \\nWe\\'ll slice them right off like skin off baloney. In a few months \\nyou\\'ll be OK.\\' \\n\\nValenti let out a yell but Fontane was still frowning. ‘How \\nabout singing afterwards, how will it affect my singing?* \\n\\n\\n3^5 \\n\\n\\n\\nJules shrugged. ‘On that there’s no guarantee. But since \\nyou can’t sing now what’s the difference?’ \\n\\nFontane looked at him with distaste. ‘Kid, you don’t know \\nwhat the hell you’re talking about. You act like you’re giving \\nme good news when what you’re telling me is maybe I \\nwon’t sing any more. Is that right, maybe I won’t sing any \\nmore?’ \\n\\nFinally Jules was disgusted* He’d operated as a real doctor \\nand it had been a pleasure. He had done this bastard a real \\nfavour and he was acting as if he’d been done dirt. Jules said \\ncoldly, ‘Listen, Mr Fontane, I’m a doctor of medicine and you \\ncan call me Doctor, not kid. And I did give you very good \\nnews. When I brought you down here I was certain that you \\nhad a malignant growth in your larynx which would entail \\ncutting out your whole vpice box. Or which could kill you. \\nI was worried that I might have to tell you that you were a \\ndead man. And I was so delighted when 1 could say the word \\n“warts”. Because your singing gave me so much pleasure, \\nhelped me seduce girls when I was younger, and you’re a real \\nartist. But also you’re a very spoiled guy. Do you think because \\nyou’re Johnny Fontane you can’t get cancet? Of a brain \\ntumour that’s idoperable? Or a failure of the heart? Do you \\nthink you’re never going to die? Well, it’s not all sweet music \\nand if you want lo see real trouble take a walk through this \\nhospital and you’ll sing a love song about warts. So just stop \\nthe crap and get on with what you have to do. Your Adolphe \\nMenjou medical man can get you the proper surgeon but if he \\ntries to get into the operating room 1 suggest you have him \\narrested for attempted murder.’ \\n\\nJules started to walk out of the room when Valenti said, \\n‘Attaboy, Doc, that’s telling him.’ \\n\\nJules whirled around and said, ‘Do you always get looped \\nbefore noontime?* \\n\\nValenti said, ‘ Sure,’ and grinned at him and with such good \\nhumour that Jules said more gently than he had meant to, \\n‘ You have to figure you’ll be dead in five years if you keep that \\nup.’ \\n\\nValenti was lumbering up to him with little dancing steps. \\nHe threw his arms around Jules, his breath stank of bourbon. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe was Jaughing very hard. ‘Five years?* he asked still laugh- \\ning. ‘Is it going to take that /ong?* \\n\\n\\nA month after her operation Lucy Mancini sat beside the \\nVegas hotel pool, one hand holding a cocktail, the other hand \\nstroking Jules’ head, which lay in her lap. \\n\\n‘You don’t have to build up your courage,’ Jules said \\ntea singly. ‘I have champagne waiting in our suite.’ \\n\\n‘Arc you sure it’s OK so soon?’ Lucy asked. \\n\\n‘I’m the doctor,’ Jules said. ‘Tonight’s the big night. Do \\nyou realize I’ll be the first surgeon in medical history who tried \\nout the results of his “medical first” operation? You know, \\nthe Before and After. I’m going ro enjoy writing it up for the \\njournals. Let’s sec, “ while the Before was distinctly pleasurable \\nfor psychological reasons and the sophistication of the sur- \\ngeon-instructor, the post-operative coitus was extremely re- \\nwarding strictly for its neurological”’ - he stopped talking \\nbecause Lucy had yanked on his hair hard enough for him ro \\nyell with pain. \\n\\nShe smiled down at him. ‘If you’re not satisfied tonight J \\ncan really say it’s your fault,’ she said. \\n\\n‘I guarantee my work. I planned it even though I just let \\nold Kellner do the manual labour,’ Jules said. ‘Now let’s just \\nrest up, we have a long night of research ahead.’ \\n\\nWhen they went up to their suite - they were living together \\nnow - Lucy found a surprise waiting: a gourmet supper and \\nnext to her champagne glass, a jeweller’s box with a huge dia- \\nmond engagement ring inside it. \\n\\n‘ That shows you how much confidence I have in my work,’ \\nJules said. ‘Now let’s see you earn it.’ \\n\\nHe was very tender, very gentle with her. She was a little \\nscary at first, her flesh jumping away from his touch but then, \\nreassured, she felt her body building up to a passion she had \\nnever known, and when they were done the first time and \\nJules whispered, ‘1 do good work,’ she whispered back, ‘Oh, \\nyes, you do; yes, you do.’ And they both laughed to each other \\nas they started making love again. \\n\\n\\n5*5 \\n\\n\\n\\nBook VI \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE \\n\\nA F ri . R r I V E months of exile in Sicily, Michael Corlcone came \\nfinally to understand his father’s character and his destiny. He \\ncame to understand men like Luca Brasi, the ruthless capo- \\nregime Clcmen?:a, his mother’s resignation and acceptance of \\nher role. For in Sicily he saw what they would have been if \\nthey had chosen not to stnigglc against their fate. He under- \\nstood why the Don always said, ‘A man has only one destiny.’ \\nHe came to understand the contempt for authority and legal \\ngovernment, the hatred for any man who broke omertay the \\nlaw of silence. \\n\\nDressed in old clothes and a billed cap, Michael had been \\ntransported from the ship docked at Palermo to the interior \\nof the Sicilian island, to the very heart of a province controlled \\nby the Mafia, whe re the local capo-mafioso was greatly indebted \\nto his fathet for some past service. The province held the town \\nof Corlcone, whose name the Don had taken when he emi- \\ngrated to America so long ago. But there were no longer any \\nof the Don’s relatives alive. The women had died of old age. \\nAll the men had been killed in vendettas or had also emigrated, \\ncither America, Brazil or to some other province on the \\nItaliari mainland. He was to learn later that this small poverty- \\nstricken town had the highest murder rate of any place in the \\nworld. \\n\\n!Ntich:H\\'l was installed as a guest in the home of a bachelor \\nuncle of thi, ftipn-W\\'fiow, The uncle, in his seventies, was also \\nthe doctor for the disirict. The capo-mafioso was a man in his \\nlaic fifties named Don Tommasino and he operated as the \\ngabbeih/fo for a huge estate belonging to one of Sicily’s most \\nnoble families. gabbeliottOy a sort of overseer to the estates \\nof the rich, also guaranteed that the poor would not try to \\nclaim land not being cultivated, would not try to encroach in \\nany way on the estate, by poaching or trying to farm it as \\n\\n326 \\n\\n\\n\\nsquatters. In short, the gahhelioito was a mafioso who foi a cer- \\ntain sum of money protected the real estate of the rich from all \\nclaims made on it by the poor, legal or ill eg. When any poor \\npeasant tried to implement the law which permitted him to buy \\nuncultivated land, the gubhillotit frightened him off with \\nthreats of bodily harm or death. It was that simple. \\n\\nDon Ttjmmasino also controlled the water rights in the area \\nand vetoed the local building of any new dams bv the Roman \\ngovernment. Such dams would ruin the lucrative business of \\nselling water from the artesian wells he controlled, make water \\ntoo cheap, ruin the whole important water economy so \\nlaboriously built up over hundreds of years. However, Don \\nTommasino was an old-fashioned Mafia chief and would have \\nnothing to do with dope traffic or prostitution. In this Don \\n\\'1 ommasino w^as at odds with the new breed of Mafia leaders \\nspringing up in big cities like Palermo, new men who, in- \\nfluenced by American gangsters deported to Italy, had no sucli \\nscruples. \\n\\nThe Mafia chief w^as an extremely portly man, a ‘man with a \\nbelly’, literally as well as in the figurative sense that meant a \\nman able to inspire fear in his fellow men. Under his protec- \\ntion, Michael had nothing to fear, vet it was considered neces- \\nsary to keep the fugitive’s identity a secret. And so Michael \\nwas restricted to the walled estate of Dr Taza, the Don’s uncle. \\n\\nDr Taza was tall for a Sicilian, almost six feet, and had ruddy \\ncheeks and snow-white hair. Though in his sc venues, he went \\nevery week to Palermo to pay his respects to the younger \\nprostitutes of that city, the younger the better. Dr Taza\\'s \\nother vice was reading. He read everything and talked about \\nwhat he read to his fellow townsmen, parient^ who were \\nilliterate peasants, the estate shepherds, and this gave him a \\nlocal reputation for foolishness. What did books have to do \\nwith them? \\n\\nIn the evenings Dr Taza, Don Tommasino and Michael sat \\nin the huge garden populated with those marble statues that on \\nthis island seemed to grow out of the garden as magically as \\nthe black heady grapes. Dr Taza loved to tell stories about the \\nMafia and its exploits over the centuries and in Michael Cor- \\nIcone he had a fascinated listener. There were times when even \\n\\n\\n33^7 \\n\\n\\n\\nDon Tommasino would be carried away by the balmy air, the \\nfruity, intoxicating wine, the elegant and quiet comfort of the \\ngarden, and tell a story from his own practical experience. \\nThe doctor was the legend, the Don the reality. \\n\\nIn this antique garden, Michael Corleone learned about the \\nroots from which his father grew. That the word ‘Mafia’ had \\noriginally meant place of refiage. Then it became the name for \\nthe secret organization that sprang up to fight against the \\nrulers that had crushed the country and its people for cen- \\nturies. Sicily was a land that had been more cruelly raped than \\nany other in history. The Inquisition had tortured rich and \\npoor alike. The landowning barons and the princes of the \\nCatholic Church exercised absolute pow’er over the shepherds \\nand farmers. The police were the instruments of their power \\nand so identified with them that to be called a policeman is the \\nfoulest insult one Sicilian can hurl at another. \\n\\nFaced with the savagery of this absolute power, the suftcring \\npeople learned never to betray their anger and their hatred for \\nfear of being crushed. They learned never to make themselves \\nvulnerable by uttering any sort of threat since giving such a \\nwarning insured a quick reprisal. They learned that society was \\ntheir enemy and so when they sought redress for their wrongs \\nthey went to the rebel underground, the Mafia. And the Mafia \\ncemented its power by originating the law of silence, the \\nvmerta^ In the countryside of Sicily a stranger asking directions \\nto the nearest town will not even receive the courtesy of an \\nanswer. And the greatest crime any member of the Mafia could \\ncommit would be to tell the police the name of the man who \\nhad just shot him or done him any kind of injury. Omerta be- \\ncame the religion of the people. A woman whose husband has \\nbeen murdered would not tell the police the name of her hus- \\nband’s murderer, not even of her child’s murderer, her \\ndaughter’s taper. \\n\\nJustice had never been forthcoming from the authorities and \\nso the people had always gone to the Robin Hood Mafia. And \\nto some extent the Mafia still fulfilled this role. People turned \\nto their local capo-mafioso for help in every emergency. He teas \\ntheir social worker, their district captain ready with a basket \\nof food and a job, their protector. \\n\\n328 \\n\\n\\n\\nliut what Dc Taza did not add, what Michael learned on his \\now\\'n in the months that followed, was that the Mafia in Sicily \\nhad become the illegal arm of the rich and even the auxiliary \\n|K)lice of the legal and political structure. It had become a \\ndegenerate capitalist structure, anti-communist, anti -liberal, \\nplacing its own taxes on every form of business endeavour no \\nmatter bow small. \\n\\nMichael Corleone understood for the first time why men like \\nhis father chose to become thieves and murderers rather than \\nmembers of the legal society. The poverty and fear of degrada- \\ntion were too awful to be acceptable to any man of spirit. And \\nin America some emigrating Sicilians had assumed there would \\nbe an equally cruel authority. \\n\\nDr Taza offered to take Michael into Palermo with him on \\nhis weekly visit to the bordello but Michael refused. His flight \\nto Sicily had prevented him from getting proper medical \\ntreatment for his smashed jaw and he now carried a memento \\nfrom Captain McCluskcy on the left side of his face. The bones \\nhad knitted badly, throwing his profile askew, giving him the \\nappearance of depravity when viewed from that side. He had \\nalways been vain about his looks and this upset him more than \\nhe thought possible. The pain that came and went he didn’t \\nmind at all. Dr Taza gave him some pills that deadened it. \\nTaza offered to treat his face but Michael refused. He had been \\nthere long enough to learn that Dr Taza was perhaps the worst \\nphysician in Sicily. Dr Taza read everything but his medical \\nliterature, which he admitted he could not understand. He had \\npassed his medical exams through the good offices of the most \\nimportant Mafia chief in Sicily who had made a special trip \\nto Palermo to confer with Taza’s professors aboujt what grades \\nthey should give him. And this too showed how the Mafia \\nin Sicily was cancerous to the society it inhabited. Merit \\nmeant nothing. Talent meant nothing. Work meant nothing. \\nThe Mafia G^father gave you your profession as a gift. \\n\\nMichael had plenty of time to think things out. During the \\nday he took walks in the countryside, always accompanied by \\ntwo of the shepherds attached to Don Tommasino’s estate. \\nThe shepherds of the island were often recruited to act as the \\nMafia’s Ured killers and did their job simply to earn money to \\n\\n5Z9 \\n\\n\\n\\nlive. Michael thought about his £ather’8 organi2ation. If it \\ncontinued to prosper it would grow into what had happened \\nhere on this island, so cancerous that it would destroy the \\nwhole country. Sicily was already a land of ghosts, its men \\nemigrating to every other country on earth to be able to earn \\ntheir bread, or simply to escape being murdered for exercising \\ntheir political and economic freedoms. \\n\\nOn his long walks the most striking thing in Michael’s eyes \\nwas the magnificent beauty of the country ; he walked through \\nthe orange orchards that formed shady deep caverns through \\nthe countryside with their ancient conduits splashing water out \\nof the fanged mouths of great snake stones carved before Christ. \\nHouses built like ancient Roman villas, with huge marble \\nportals and great vaulted rooms, falling into ruins or in- \\nhabited bv stray sheep. On the horizon the bony hills shone \\nlike picked bleached bones piled high. Gardens and fields, \\nsparkly green, decorated the desert landscape like bright emer- \\nald necldaces. And sometimes he walked as far as the town of \\nCorleone, its eighteen thousand people strung out in dwellings \\nthat pitted the side of the nearest mountain, the mean hovels \\nbuilt out of black rock quarried from the mountain. In the last \\nyear there had been over sixty murders in Corleone and it \\nseemed that death shadowed the town. Further on, the wood \\nof Ficuzza broke the savage monotony of arable plain. \\n\\nHis two shepherd bodyguards always carried their tuparas \\nwith them when accompanying Michael on his walks. The \\ndeadly Sicilian shotgun was the favourite weapon of the Mafia. \\nIndeed the police chief sent by Mussolini to clean the Mafia out \\nof Sicily had, as one of his first steps, ordered all stone walls \\nin §icilv to be knocked down to not more than three feet in \\nheight so that murderers with their luparas could not use the \\nwalls as ambush points for their assassinations. This didn’t \\nhelp much and the police minister solved his problem by \\narresting and deporting to penal colonies any male suspected \\nof being a mafioso. \\n\\nWhen the island of Sicily was liberated by the Allied Armies, \\nthe American military government officials believed that any- \\none imprisoned by the Fascist regime was a democrat and \\nmany of these mafiosi were appointed as mayors of villages or \\n\\n\\n\\ninterpreters to the military government. This good fortune \\nenabled the Mafia to reconstitute itself and become more \\nformidable than ever before. \\n\\nThe long walks, a bottle of strong wine at night with a heavy \\nplate of pasta and meat, enabled Michael to sleep. There were \\nbooks in Italian in Dr Taza’s library and though Michael spoke \\ndialect Italian and had taken some college courses in Italian, his \\nreading of these books took a great deal of effort and time. \\nHis speech became almost accent less and, though he could \\nnever pass as a native of the district, it would be believed that \\nbe was one of those strange Italians from the far north of Italy \\nbordering the Swiss and Germans. \\n\\nThe distortion of the left side of his face made him more \\nnative. It was the kind of disfigurement common in Sicily \\nbecause of the lack of medical care. The little injury that \\ncannot be patched up simply for lack of money. Many children, \\nmany men, bore disfigurements that in America would have \\nbeen repaired by minor surgery or sophisticated medical treat- \\nments. \\n\\nMichael often thought of Kay, of her smile, her body, and \\nalways felt a twinge of conscience at leaving her so brutally \\nwithout a word of farewell. Oddly enough his conscience was \\nnever troubled by the two men he had murdered; Sollozzo \\nhad tried to kill his father. Captain McCluskey had disfigured \\nhim for life. \\n\\nDr Taza always kept after him about getting surgery done \\nfor his lopsided face, especially when Michael asked him for \\npain-killing drugs, the pain getting worse as time went on, and \\nmore frequent. Taza explained that there was a facial nerve \\nbelow the eye from which radiated a whole complex of nerves. \\nIndeed, this was the favourite spot for Mafia torturers, who \\nsearched it out on the cheeks of their victims with the needle- \\nfine point of an ice pick. That particular nerve in Michael’s \\nface had been injured or perhaps there was a splinter of bone \\nlanced into it. Simple surgery in a Palermo hospital would \\npermanendy relieve the pain. \\n\\nMichael refused. When the doctor asked why, Michael \\ngrinned and said, \\'It’s something from home.’ \\n\\nAnd he really didn’t mind the pain, which was more an ache. \\n\\n\\n331 \\n\\n\\n\\na small throbbing in his skull, like a motored apparatus run- \\nning in liquid to purify it. \\n\\nIt was nearly seven months of leisurely rustic living before \\nMichael felt real boredom. At about this time Don Tommasino \\nbecame very busy and was seldom seen at the villa. He was \\nhaving his troubles with the \\'new Mafia’ springing up in \\nPalermo, young men who were making a fortune out of the \\npostwar construction boom in that city. With this wealth they \\nwere trying to encroach on the country fiefs of old-time Mafia \\nleaders whom they contemptuously labelled Moustache Petes. \\nDon Tommasino was kept busy defending his domain. And so \\nMichael was deprived of the old man’s company and had to \\nbe content with Dr Taza’s stories, which were beginning to \\nrepeat themselves. \\n\\nOne morning Michael decided to take a long hike to the \\nhiountains beyond Corleone. He was, naturally, accompanied \\nby the two shepherd bodyguards. This was not really a pro- \\ntection against enemies of the Corleone Family. It was simply \\ntoo dangerous for anyone not a native to go wandering about \\nby himself. It was dangerous enough for a native. The region \\nwas loaded with bandits, with Mafia partisans fighting against \\neach other and endangering everybody else in the process. He \\nmight also be mistaken for a pagliaio thief. \\n\\nA pagliaio is a straw-thatched hut erected in the fields to \\nhouse farming tools and to provide shelter for the agricultural \\nlabourers so that they will not have to carry them on the long \\nwalk from their homes in the village. In Sicily the peasant does not \\nlive on the land he cultivates. It is too dangerous and any arable \\nland, if he owns it, is too precious. Rather, he lives in his village \\nand at sunrise begins his voyage out to work in distant fields, a \\ncommuter on foot, A worker who arrived at his pagliaio and \\nfound it looted was an injured man indeed. The bread was \\ntaken out of his mouth for that day. The Mafia, after the \\nlaw proved helpless, took this interest of the peasant under its \\nprotection and solved the problem in typical fashion. It hunted \\ndown and slaughtered all pagliaio thieves. It was inevitable \\nthat some innocents suffered. It was possible that if Michael \\nwandered past a pagliaio that had just been looted he might be \\nadjudged diecriinmal unless he had somebody tovouchfor him. \\n\\n\\n35 * \\n\\n\\n\\nSo on one sunny morning he started hiking across the fields \\nfollowed by his two faithi^i shepherds. One of them was a \\nplain simple fellow, almost moronic, silent as the dead and \\nwith a face as impassive as an Indian. He had the wiry build of \\nthe typical Sicilian before they ran to the fat of middle age. \\nHis name was Calo, \\n\\nThe other shepherd was more outgoing, younger, and had \\nseen something of the world. Mostly oceans, since he had been \\na sailor in the Italian navy during the war and had just had \\ntime enough to get himself tattooed before his ship was sunk \\nand he was captured by the British. But the tattoo made him a \\nfamous man in his village. Sicilians do not often let themselves \\nbe tattooed, they do not have the opportunity nor the inclina- \\ntion. (The shepherd, Fabrizzio, had done so primarily to cover \\na splotchy red birthmark on his belly.) And yet the Mafia \\nmarket carts had gaily painted scenes on their sides, beautifully \\nprimitive paintings done with loving care. In any case, Fab- \\nrizzio, back in his native village, was not too proud of that \\ntattoo on his chest, though it showed a subject dear to the \\nSicilian ^ honour a husband stabbing a naked man and woman \\nentwined together on the hairy floor of his belly. Fabrizzio \\nwould joke with Michael and ask questions about America, for \\nof course it was impossible to keep them iri the dark about his \\ntrue nationality. Still, they did not know exactly who he was \\nexcept that he was in hiding and there could be no babbling \\nabout him. Fabrizzio sometimes brought Michael a fresh \\ncheese still sweating the milk that formed it. \\n\\nThey walked along dusty country roads passing donkeys \\npulling gaily painted carts. The land was filled with pink \\nflowers, orange orchards, groves of almond and 61ive trees, all \\nblooming. That had been one of the surprises- Michael had \\nexpected a barren land because of the legendary poverty of \\nSicilians. And yet he had found it a land of gushing plenty, \\ncarpcjted with flowers scented by lemon blossoms. It was so \\nbeautiful that he wondered how its people could bear to leave \\nit. How terrible man had been to his fellow man could, be \\nmeasured by the great exodus from what seemed to be a \\nGarden of Eden. \\n\\nHe had planned to walk to the coastal village of Mazara, and \\n\\n535 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\'then take a bus back to Corleone in the evening, and so dre \\nhimself out and be able to sleep. The two shepherds wore \\nrucksacks filled with bread and cheese they could eat on the \\nway. They carried their luparas quite openly as if out for a day’s \\nhunting. \\n\\nIt was a most beautiful morning. Michael felt as he had felt \\nwhen as a child he had gone out early on a summer day to play \\nball. Then each day had been freshly washed, freshly painted. \\nAnd so it was now. Sicily was carpeted in gaudy flowers, the \\nscent of orange and lemon blossoms so heavy that even with \\nhis facial injury which pressed on the sinuses, he could smell it. \\n\\nThe smashing on the left side of his face had completely \\nhealed but the bone had formed improperly and the pressure \\non his sinuses made his left eye hurt. It also made his nose run \\ncontinually, he filled up handkerchiefs with mucus and often \\nblew his nose out on to the ground as the local peasants did, \\na habit that had disgusted him when he was a boy and had seen \\nold Italians, disdaining handkerchiefs as English foppery, \\nblow out their noses in the asphalt gutters. \\n\\nHis face too felt * heavy’. Dr Taza had told him that this \\nwas due to the pressure on his sinuses caused by the badly \\nhealed fracture. Dr Taza called it an eggshell fracture of the \\nzygoma; that if it had been treated before the bones knitted, it \\ncould have been easily remedied by a minor surgical procedure \\nusing an instrument like a spoon to push out the bone to its \\nproper shape. Now, however, said the doctor, he would have \\nto ^cck into a Palermo hospital and undergo a major pro- \\ncedure called maxillo-facial surgery where the bone would be \\nbroken again. That was enough for Michael. He refused. And \\nyet^more than the pain, more than the nose dripping, he was \\nbothered by the feeling of heaviness in his face. \\n\\nHe never reached the coast that day. After going about \\nfifteen miles he and his shepherds stopped in the cool green \\nwatery shade of an orange grove to eat lunch and drink their \\nwine. Fabrizzio was chattering about how he would someday \\nget to America. After drinking and eating they lolled in the \\nshade and Fabrizzio unbuttoned his shirt and contracted his \\nstomach muscles to make the tattoo come alive. The naked \\ncouple on his chest writhed in a lover’s agony and the dagger \\n\\n\\n534 \\n\\n\\n\\nthrust by the husband quivered in their transfixed flesh. It \\namused them. It was while this was going on that Michael was \\nhit with what Sicilians call ‘the thunderbolt*. \\n\\nBeyond the orange grove lay the green ribboned fields of a \\nbaronial estate. Down the road from the grove was a villa so \\nRoman it looked as if it had been dug up from the ruins of \\nPompeii. It was a little palace with a huge marble portico and \\nfluted Grecian columns and through those columns came a \\nbevy of village girls flanked by two stout matrons clad in \\nblack. They were from the village and had obviously fulfilled \\ntheir ancient duty to the local baron by cleaning his villa and \\notherwise preparing it for his winter sojourn. Now they were \\ngoing into the fields to pick the flowers with which they would \\nfill the rooms. They were gathering the pink suUa^ purple \\nwisteria, mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms. The \\ngirls, not seeing the men resting in the orange grove, came \\ncloser and closer. \\n\\nThey were dressed in cheap gaily printed frocks that clung \\nto their bodies. They were still in their teens but with the full \\nwomanliness sun-drenched flesh ripened into so quickly. Three \\nor four of them started chasing one girl, chasing her towards \\nthe grove. The girl being chased held a bunch of huge purple \\ngrapes in her left hand and with her right hand was picking \\ngrapes off the cluster and throwing them at her pursuers. She \\nhad a crown of ringleted hair as purple-black as the grapes and \\nher body seemed to be bursting out of its skin. \\n\\nJust short of the grove she poised, startled, her eyes having \\ncaught the alien colour of the men’s shirts. She stood there up \\non her toes poised like a deer to run. She was very close now, \\nclose enough for the men to see every detail of her face. \\n\\nShe was all ovals - oval-shaped eyes, the bones of her face, \\nthe contour of her brow. Her skin was an exquisite dark \\ncreaminess and her eyes, enormous, dark violet or brown but \\n3ark with long heavy lashes shadowed her lovely face. Her \\nmouth was rich without being gross, sweet without being weak \\nand dyed dark red with the juice of the grapes. She was so \\nincredibly lovely that Fabrizaio murmured, ‘Jesus Christ, take \\nmy soul, Fm dying,’ as a joke, but the words came out a little \\ntoo hoarsely. As if she bad heard him^ the girl came down off \\n\\n\\n535 \\n\\n\\n\\nher toes and whirled away from them and fled back to her \\npursuers. Her haunches moved like an animal’s beneath the \\ntight print of hei dress; as pagan and as innocently lustful. \\nWhen she reached her friends she whirled around again and \\nher face was like a dark hollow against the field of bright \\nflowers. She extended an arm, the hand full of grapes pointed \\ntowards the grove. The girls fled laughing, with the black- \\nclad, stout matrons scolding them on. \\n\\nAs for Michael Corleone, he found himself standing, his \\nheart pounding in his chest ; he felt a little dbaay. The blood was \\nsurging through his body, through all its extremities and \\npounding against the tips of his fingers, the tips of his toes. \\nAll the perfumes of the island came rushing in on the wind, \\norange, lemon blossoms, grapes, flowers. It seemed as if his \\nbody had sprung away from him out of himself. And then he \\nheard the two shepherds laughing. \\n\\n‘You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?* Fabriazio said, clap- \\nping him on the shoulder. Even Calo became friendly, patting \\nhim on the arm and saying, * Easy, man, easy,* but with affec- \\ntion. As if Michael had been hit by a car. Fabrizzio handed him \\na wine bottle and Michael took a long slug. It cleared his head. \\n\\n‘What the hell are you damn sheep lovers talking about?’ \\nhe said. \\n\\nBoth men laughed. Calo, his honest face filled with the ut- \\nmost seriousness, said, ‘You can’t hide the thunderbolt. When it \\nhits you, everybody can see it. Christ, man, don’t be ashamed of it, \\nsome men pray for the thunderbolt. You’re a lucky feUow.’ \\n\\nMichael wasn’t too pleased about his emotions being so \\neasily read. But this was the first time in his life such a thing \\nhad happened to him. It was nothing like his adolescent \\ncrushes, it was nothing like the love he’d had for Kay, a love \\nbased as much on her sweetness, her intelligence, and the pol- \\narity of the fair and dark. This was an overwhelming desire for \\npossession, this was an inerasable printing of the girl’s face \\non his brain and he knew she would haunt his memory every \\nday of his life if he did not possess her. His life had become \\nsimplified, focused on one point, everything else was unworthy \\nof even a moment’s attention. During his exile he had always \\nthought of Kay, though he felt they could never again he \\n\\n\\n\\nlovers or even friends. He was» after all was said, a morderer, \\na mafioso who had ‘made his bones’. But now Kay was wiped \\ncompletely out of his consciousness. \\n\\nFabrizzio said briskly, ‘I’ll go to the village, we’ll find out \\nabout her. Who knows, she may be more available than we \\nthink. There’s only one cure for the thunderbolt, eh, Calo?’ \\n\\nThe other shepherd noddec^his head gravely. Michael didn’t \\nsay anything. He followed the two shepherds as they started \\ndown the road to the nearby village into which the flock of \\ngirls had disappeared. \\n\\nThe village was grouped around the usual central square \\nwith its fountain. But it was on a main route so there were \\nsome stores, wine shops, and one litde caf(6 with three tables \\nout on a small terrace. The shepherds sat at one of the tables \\nand Michael joined them. There was no sign of the girls, not \\na trace. The village seemed deserted except for small boys and \\na meandering donkey. \\n\\nThe proprietor of the cafi£ came to serve them. He was a \\nshort, burly man, almost dwarfish but he greeted them cheer- \\nfully and set a dish of chickpeas at their table. ‘You’re \\nstrangers here,* he said, ‘so let me advise you. Try my wine. \\nThe grapes come from my own farm and it’s made by my \\nsons themselves. They mix it with oranges and lemons. It’s \\nthe best wine in Italy.’ \\n\\nThey let him bring the wme in a jug and it was even better \\nthan he claimed, dark purple and as powerful as a brandy. \\nFabrizzio said to the cafe proprietor, ‘You know all the girls \\nhere. I’ll bet. We saw some l^uties coming down the road, \\none in particular got our friend here hit with the thunderbolt.’ \\nHe motioned to Michael. \\n\\nThe caff owner looked at Michael with new interest. The \\ncracked face had seemed quite ordinary to him before, not \\nworth a second glance. But a man hit with the thunderbolt \\nwas another matter. ‘You had better bring a few bottles home \\nwith you tonight, my friend,’ he said.. ‘You’ll need help in \\ngetting to sleep tonight.’ \\n\\nMichael asked the man, ‘ Do you know a girl with her hair \\nall curly? Very creamy skin, very big eyes, very dark eyes. Do \\nyou know a girl like that in the village?’ \\n\\n\\n337 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe cafif owner said curtly, ‘No. I don’t know any girl like \\nthat.’ He vanished from the terrace into his cafd. \\n\\nThe three men drank their wine slowly, finished off the jug \\nand called for more. The owner did not reappear. Fabrizzio \\nwent into the caf(6 after him. When Fabrizzio came out he \\ngrimaced and said to Michael, ‘Just as I thought, it’s his \\ndaughter we were talking about and now he’s in the back \\nboiling up his blood to do us a mischief. I think we’d better \\nstart walking towards Corleone.* \\n\\nDespite his months on the island Michael still could not get \\nused to the Sicilian touchiness on matters of sex, and this was \\nextreme even for a Sicilian. But the two shepherds seemed to \\ntake it as a matter of course. They were waiting for him to leave. \\nFabrizzio said, ‘The old bastard mentioned he has two sons, \\nbig tough lads that he has only to whistle up. Let’s get going.’ \\n\\nMichael gave him a cold stare. Up to now he had been a \\nquiet, gentle young man, a typical American, except that since \\nhe was hiding in Sicily he must have done something manly. \\nThis was the first time the shepherds had seen the Corleone \\nstare. Don Tommasino, knowing Michael’s true identity and \\ndeed, had always been wary of him, treating him as a fellow \\n‘man of respect’. But these unsophisticated sheep herders had \\ncome to their own opinion of Michael, and not a wise one. The \\ncold look, Michael’s rigid white face, his anger that came oflF \\nhim like cold smoke off ice, sobered their laughter and snuffed \\nout their familiar friendliness. \\n\\nWhen he saw he had their proper, respectful attention \\nMichael said to them, ‘Get that man out here to me.’ \\n\\nThey didn’t hesitate. They shouldered their luparas and went \\ninto the dark coolness of the caff. A few seconds later they \\nreappeared with the cafe owner between them. The stubby \\nman looked in no way frightened but his anger had a certain \\nwariness about it. \\n\\nMichael leaned back in his chair and studied the man for a \\nmoment. Then he said very quietly, ‘I understand I’ve offended \\nyou by talking about your daughter. I offer you my apologies. \\nI’m a stranger in this country, I don’t know the customs that \\nwell. Let me say this. I meant no disrespect to you or her.’ \\n\\nThe shepherd bodyguards were impressed. Michael’s voice \\n\\n338 \\n\\n\\n\\nhad never sounded like this before when speaking to them. \\nThere was command and authority in it though he was making \\nan apology. The caft owner shrugged, more wary still, know- \\ning he was not dealing with some farmboy. ‘ Who are you and \\nwhat do you want from my daughter?’ \\n\\nWithout even hesitating Michael said, ‘I am an American \\nhiding in Sicily, from the police of my country. My name is \\nMichael. You can inform the police and make yout fortune \\nbut then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a \\nhusband. In any case I want to meet your daughter. With your \\npermission and under the supervision of your family. With all \\ndecorum. With all respect. I’m an honourable man and I don’t \\nthink of dishonouring your daughter. I want to meet her, talk \\nto her, and then if it hits us both right we’ll marry. If not, you’ll \\nnever see me again. She may find me unsympathetic after all, \\nand no man can remedy that. But when the proper time comes \\nI’ll tell you everything about me that a wife’s father should \\nknow.* \\n\\nAll three men were looking at him with amazement. Fab- \\nrizzio whispered in awe, ‘It’s the real thunderbolt.’ The cafe \\nowner, for the first time, didn’t look so confident, or con- \\ntemptuous; his anger was hot so sure. Finally he asked, ‘Are \\nyou a friend of the friends?’ \\n\\nSince the word Mafia could never be uttered aloud by the \\nordinary Sicilian, this was as close as the cafi^ owner could \\ncome to asking if Michael was a member of the Mafia. It was \\nthe usual way of asking if someone belonged but it was \\nordinarily not addressed to the person directly concerned. \\n\\n‘No,’ Michael said. ‘I’m a stranger in this country.’ \\n\\nThe caf(§ owner gave him another look, the smashed left \\nside of his face, the long legs rare in Sicily. He took a look at \\nthe two shepherds carrying their iuparas quite openly without \\nfear and remembered how they had come into his caff and \\ntold him their padrone wanted to talk to him. The caff owner \\nhad snarled that he wanted the son of a bitch out of his terrace \\nand one of the shepherds had said, ‘Take my word, it’s best \\nyou go out and speak to him yourself,’ And something had \\nmade him come out. Now something made him realize that it \\nwould be best to show this stranger some courtesy. He said \\n\\n\\n519 \\n\\n\\n\\ngrudgingly, *Come Sunday afternoon. My name is Vitelli and \\nmy house is up there on the hill, above the village. But come \\nhere to the cafif and I’ll take you up.’ \\n\\nFabtizzio started to say something but Michael gave him one \\nlook and the shepherd’s tongue froze in his mouth. This was \\nnot lost on Vitelli. So when Michael stood up and stretched \\nout his hand, the caf^ owner took it and smiled. He would \\nmake some inquiries and if the answers were wrong he could \\nalways greet Michael with his two sons bearing their own \\nshotguns. The caf<^ owner was not without his contacts among \\nthe * friends of the friends’. But something told him this was \\none of those wild strokes of good fortune diat Sicilians always \\nbelieved in, something told him that his daughter’s beauty \\nwould make her fortune and her family secure. And it was just \\nas well. Some of the local youths were already beginning to \\nbuzz around and this stranger with his broken face could do the \\nnecessary job of scaring them off. Vitelli, to show his goodwill, \\nsent the strangers off with a bottle of his best and coldest wine. \\nHe noticed that one of the shepherds paid the bill. This im- \\npressed him even more, made it clear that Michael was the \\nsuperior of the two men who accompanied him. \\n\\nMichael was no longer interested in his hike. They foimd a \\ngarage and hired a car and driver to take them back to Cor- \\nleonc, and some time before supper. Dr Taza must have been \\ninformed by the shepherds of what had happened. That even- \\ning, sitting in the garden. Dr Taza said to Don Tommasino, \\n*Our friend got hit by the thunderbolt today.’ \\n\\nDon Tommasino not seem surprised. He grunted. * I \\nwish some of those young feUows in Palermo would get a \\nthunderbolt, maybe I could get some peace.’ He was talking \\nabout the new-style Maha chiefs rising in the big cities like \\nPalermo and challenging the power of old-regime stalwarts \\nlike himself. \\n\\nMichael said to Tommasino, want you to tell those two \\nsheep herders to leave me alone Sunday. I’m going to go to \\nthis girl’s family for dinner and I don’t want them hanging \\naround.’ \\n\\nDon Tommasino shook his head. H’m responsible to your \\nfather for you, don’t ask me that. Another thing, I hear you’ve \\n\\n\\n340 \\n\\n\\n\\neven talked marriage. I can’t aOow that until I’ve sent some- \\nbody to speak to your father.’ \\n\\nMichael Corleone was very careful, this was after all a man \\nof respect. *Don Tommasino, you know my father. He’s a \\nman who goes deaf when somebody says the word no to him. \\nAnd he doesn’t get his hearing back until they answer him \\nwith a yes. Well, he has heard my no many times. I understand \\nabout the two guards, I don’t want to cause you trouble, they \\ncan come with me Sunday, but if I want to marry I’ll marry. \\nSurely if I don’t permit my own father to interfere with my \\npersonal life it would \\'be an insult to him to allow you to do so.’ \\n\\nThe capo-mafioso sighed. ‘ Well, then, marriage it will have to \\nbe. I know your thunderbolt. She’s a good girl from a re- \\nspectable family. You can’t dishonour them without the father \\ntrying to kill you, and then you’ll have to shed blood. Besides, \\n[ know the family well, I can’t allow it to happen.’ \\n\\nMichael said, * She may not be able to stand ^e sight of me, \\nand she’s a very young girl, she’ll think me old.’ He saw the \\ntwo men smiling at him. ^Fll need some money for presents \\nand I think I’ll need a car.’ \\n\\nThe Don nodded. ‘Fabrizaio will take care of everything, \\nhe’s a clever boy, they taught him mechanics in the navy. I’ll \\ngive you some money in the morning and I’ll let your father \\nknow what’s happening. That I must do.’ \\n\\nMichael said to Dr Taza, ‘Have you got anything that can \\ndry up this damn snot always coming out of my nose? I can’t \\nhave that girl seeing me wiping it all the time.’ \\n\\nDr Taza said, ‘ I’ll coat it with a drug before you have to see \\nher. It makes your flesh a little numb but, don’t worry, you \\nwon’t be kissing her for a while yet.’ Both doctor and Don \\nsmiled at this witticism. \\n\\nBy Sunday, Michael had an Alfa Romeo, battered but ser- \\nviceable, He had also made a bus trip to Palermo to buy pre- \\nsents for the girl and her family. He had learned that the girl’s \\nname was Apollonia and every night he thought of her lovely \\nface and her lovely naxtie. He had to drink a good deal of wine \\nto get some sleep and orders were given to the old women ser- \\nvants in the house to leave a chilled bottle at his bedside. He \\ndrank it empty every night. \\n\\n\\n541 \\n\\n\\n\\nOn Sunday, to the tolling qf church bells that coveted aU of \\nSicily, he drove the Alfa R<)mco to the village and parked it \\njust outside the caffe. Calo and Fabrizaio were in the back seat \\nwith their luparas and Michael told them they were to wait in \\nthe caffe, they were not to come to the house. The caffe was \\nclosed but Vitelli was there waiting for them, leaning against \\nthe railing of his empty terrace. \\n\\nThey shook hands aU around and Michael took the three \\npackages, the presents, and trudged up the hill with Vitelli to \\nhis home. This proved to be larger than the usual village hut, \\nthe Vitellis were not poverty-stricken. \\n\\nInside the house was familiar with statues of the Madonna \\nentombed in glass, votive lights flickering redly at their feet. \\nThe two sons were waiting, also dressed in their Sunday black. \\nThey were two sturdy young men just out of their teens but \\nlool^g older because of their hard work on the farm. The \\nmother was a vigorous woman, as stout as her husband. There \\nwas no sign of the girl. \\n\\nAfter the introductions, which Michael did not even hear, \\nthey sat in the room that might possibly have been a living \\nroom or just as easily the formal dining room. It was cluttered \\nwith all Idnds of furniture and not very large but for Sicily it \\nwas middle-class splendour. \\n\\nMichael gave Signor Vitelli and Signora Vitelli their pre- \\nsents. For the father it was a gold cigar-cutter, for the mother \\na bolt of the finest cloth purchasable in Palermo. He still had \\none package for the girl. His presents were received with \\nreserved thanks. The gifts were a little too premature, he \\nshould not have given anything until his second visit. \\n\\n,Thc father said to him, in man-to-man country fashion, \\n‘DonH think we’re so of no account to welcome strangers into \\nour house so easily. But Don Tommasino vouched for you per- \\nsonally and nobody in this province would ever doubt the word \\nof that good man. And so we make you welcome. But I must \\ntell you that if your intentions are serious about my daughter, \\nwe will have to know a little more about you and your family. \\nYou can understand, your family is from this country.* \\n\\nMichael nodded and said politely, ‘I wiU tell you anything \\nyou want to know any time.* \\n\\n\\n54 * \\n\\n\\n\\nSignor Vitelli held up a hand. ‘I\\'m not a nosy man. Let’s see \\nif it\\'s necessary first. Right now you\\'re welcome in my house \\nas a friend of Don Tommasino.* \\n\\nDespite the drug painted inside his nose, Michael actually \\nsmelled the girl’s presence in the room. He turned and she was \\nstanding in the arched doorway that led to the back of the \\nhouse. The smell was of fresh flowers and lemon blossoms but \\nshe wore nothing in her hair of jet black curls, nothing on her \\nplain severe black dress, obviously her Sunday best. She gave \\nhim a quick glance and a tiny smile before she cast her eyes \\ndown dt;murely and sat down next to her mother. \\n\\nAgain Michael felt that shortness of breath, that flooding \\nthrough his body of something that was not so much desire \\nas an insane possessiveness. He understood for the first time \\nthe classical jealousy of the Italian male. He was at that moment \\nready to kill anyone who touched this girl, who tried to claim \\nher, take her away from him. He wanted to own her as wildly \\nas a miser wants to own gold coins, as hungrily as a share- \\ncropper wants to own his own land. Nothing was going to \\nstop him from owning this girl, possessing her, locking her in \\na house, and keeping her prisoner only for himself. He didn’t \\nwant anyone even to see her. When she turned to smile at one \\nof her brothers Michael gave that young man a murderous \\nlook without even realizing it. The family could sec it was a \\nclassical case of the ‘thunderbolt’ and they were reassured. \\nThis young man would be putty in their daughter\\'s hands until \\nthey were married. After that of course things would change \\nbut it wouldn\\'t matter. \\n\\nMichael had bought himself some new clothes in Palermo \\nand was no longer the roughly dressed peasant, and it was \\nobvious to the family that he was a Don of some kind. His \\nsmashed face did not make him as evil-looking as he believed; \\nbecause his other profile was so handsome it made the dis- \\nfigurement interesting even. And in any case this was a land \\nwhere to be called disfigured you had to compete with a host \\nof men who had suffered extreme physical misfortune. \\n\\nMichael looked directly at the girl, the lovely ovab of her \\nface. Her lips now he could see were almost blue so dark was \\nthe blood pulsating in them. He said, not daring to speak her \\n\\n\\n545 \\n\\n\\n\\nname, ‘ I saw you by the orange groves the other day. When \\nyou ran away. I hope I didn’t frighten you?’ \\n\\nThe girl raised her eyes to him for just a fraction. She shook \\nher head. But the loveliness of those eyes had made Michael \\nlook away. The mother said tartly, *Apollonia, speak to the \\npoor fellow, he’s come miles to sec you,\\' but the girl’s long \\njet lashes remained closed like wings over her eyes. Michael \\nhanded her the present wrapped in gold paper and the girl \\nput it in her lap. The father said, ‘ Open it, girl,’ but her hands \\ndid not move. Her hands were small and brown, an urchin’s \\nhands. The mother reached over and opened the package \\nimpatiently, yet careful not to tear the precious paper. The red \\nvelvet jeweller’s box gave her pause, she had never held such \\na thing in her hands and didn’t know how to spring its catch. \\nBut she got it open on pure instinct and then took out the \\npresent. \\n\\nIt was a heavy gold chain to be worn as a necklace, and it \\nawed them not only because of its obvious value but because \\na gift of gold in this society was also a statement of the most \\nserious intentions. It was no less than a proposal of matrimony, \\nor rather the signal that there was the intention to propose \\nmatrimony. They could no longer doubt the seriousness of \\nthis stranger. And they could not doubt his substance. \\n\\nApoUonia still had not touched her present. Her mother \\nheld it up for her to sec and she raised those long lashes for a \\nmoment and then she looked directly at Michael, her doelike \\n^ brown eyes grave, and said, \\'Gratia* It was the first time he \\nhad heard her voice. \\n\\nIt had all the velvety softness of youth and shyness and it set \\nMichael’s ears ringing. He kept looking away from her and \\ntalking to the father and mother simply because looking at her \\nconfused him so much. But he noticed that despite the con- \\nservative looseness of her dress her body almost shone through \\nthe cloth with sheer sensuality. And he noticed the darkening \\nof her skin blushing, the dark creamy skin, going darker with \\nthe blood surging to her face. \\n\\nFinally Michael rose to go and the family rose too. They said \\ntheir goodbyes formaUy, the girl at last confronting him as \\nthey shook hands, and he felt the shock of her skin on his \\n\\n\\n344 \\n\\n\\n\\nskin, her skin warm and rough, peasant skin. The father \\nwalked down the hill with him to his car and invited him to \\nSunday dinner the next week. Michael nodded but knew he \\ncouldn’t wait a week to see the girl again. \\n\\nfie didn’t. The next day, without his shepherds, he drove to \\nthe village and sat on the garden terrace of the caft to chat with \\nher father. Signor Vitelli took pity on him and sent for his wife \\nand daughter to come down to the caf(6 to join them. This \\nmeeting was less awkward. The girl Apollonia was less shy, \\nand spoke more. She was dressed in her everyday print frock \\nwhich suited her colouring much better. \\n\\nThe next day the same thing happened. Only this time \\nApollonia was wearing the gold chain he had given her. He \\nsmiled at her then, knowing that this was a signal to him. He \\nwalked with her up the hill, her mother close behind them. \\nBut it was impossible for the two young people to keep their \\nbodies from brushing against each other and once Apollonia \\nstumbled and fell against him so that he had to hold her and her \\nbody so warm and alive in his hands started a deep wave of \\nblood rising in his body. They could not sec the mother behind \\nthem smiling because her daughter was a mountain goat and \\nhad not stumbled on this path since she was an infant in diapers. \\nAnd smiling because this was the only way this young man was \\ngoing to get his hands on her daughter until the marriage. \\n\\nThis went on for two weeks. Michael brought her presents \\nevery time he came and gradually she became less shy. But \\nthey could never meet without a chaperone being present. She \\nwas just a village girl, barely literate, with no idea of the world, \\nbut she had a freshness, an eagerness for life that, with help \\nof the language barrier, made her seem interesting. Everything \\nwent very swiftly at Michael’s request. And because the girl \\nwas not only fascinated by him but knew he must be rich, a \\nwedding date was set for the Sunday two weeks away. \\n\\nNow Don Tommasino took a hand. He had received word \\nfrom America that Michael was not subject to orders but that \\nall elementary precautions should be taken. So Don Tom- \\nmasino appointed himself the parent of the bridegroom to \\ninsure the presence of his own bodyguards. Calo and Fab- \\nrizzio were also members of the wedding party from Corleone \\n\\n\\n345 \\n\\n\\n\\nsiS Dr Taza. The bride and groom would live in Dr Ta7a’s \\nvilla .surrounded by its stone wall. \\n\\nThe wedding was the usual peasant one. The villagers stood \\nin the streets and threw flowers as the bridal party, principals \\nand guests, went on foot from the church to the bride’s home. \\nThe wedding procession pelted the neighbours with sugar- \\ncoated almonds, the traditional wedding candies, and with \\ncandies left over made sugary white mountains on the bride’s \\nwedding bed, in this case only a symbolic one since the first night \\nwould be spent in the villa outside Corleone. The wedding \\nfeast went on until midnight but bride and groom would leave \\nbefore that in the Alfa Romeo. When that time came Michael \\nwas surprised to find that the mother was coming with them \\nto the Corleone villa at the request of the bride. The father \\nexplained: the girl was young, a virgin, a little frightened, she \\nwould need someone to talk to on the morning following her \\nbridal night ; to put her on the right track if things went wrong. \\nThese matters could sometimes get very tricky. Michael saw \\nApollonia looking at him with doubt in her huge doe-brown \\neyes. He smiled at her and nodded. \\n\\nAnd so it came about that they drove back to the villa out- \\nside Corleone with the mother-in-law in the car. But the older \\nwoman immediately put her head together with the servants \\nof Dr Taza, gave her daughter a hug and a kiss and disap- \\npeared from the scene. Michael and his bride were allowed to \\ngo to their huge bedroom alone. \\n\\nApollonia was still wearing her bridal costume with a cloak \\nthrown over it. Her trunk and case had been brought up to \\nthe room from the car. On a small table was a bottle of wine \\nahd a plate of small wedding cakes. The huge canopied bed \\nwas never out of their vision. The young girl in the centre of \\nthe room waited for Michael to make the first move. \\n\\nAnd now that he had her alone, now that he legally possessed \\nher, now that there was no barrier to his enjoying that body \\nand face he had dreamed about every night, Michael could not \\nbring himself to approach her. He watched as she took off \\nthe bridal shawl and draped It over a chair, and placed the \\nbridal crown on the small dressing table. That table had \\nan array of perfumes and creams that Michael had had sent \\n\\n546 \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom Palermo. The girl tallied them with her eyes fot a \\nmoment. \\n\\nMichael turned off the lights, thinking the girl was waiting \\nfor some darkness to shield her body wl^e she undressed. But \\nthe Sicilian moon came through ^e unshuttered windows, \\nbright as gold, and Michael went to close the shutters but not \\nall the way, the room would be too warm. \\n\\nThe girl was still standing by the table and so Michael went \\nout of the room and down the hall to the bathroom. He and \\nDr Taaa and Don Tommasino had taken a glass oi wine to- \\ngether in the garden while the women had prepared themselves \\nfor bed. He had expected to find ApoUonia in her nightgown \\nwhen he returned, already between the covers. He was sur- \\nprised that the mother had not done this service fot her \\ndaughter. Maybe ApoUonia had wanted him to help her to \\nundress. But he was certain she was too shy, too innocent fot \\nsuch forward behaviour. \\n\\nComing back into the bedroom, he found it completely \\ndark, someone had closed the shutters aU the way. He groped \\nhis way towards the bed and could make out the shape of \\nApoUonia’s body lying under the covers, her back to him, her \\nbody curved away from him and huddled up. He undressed \\nand slipped naked beneath the sheets. He stretched out one \\nhand and touched silky naked skin. She had not put on her \\ngown and this boldness delighted him. Slowly, carefuUy, he \\nput one hand on her shoulder and pressed her body gently so \\nthat she would turn to him. She turned slowly and his hand \\ntouched her breast, soft, full and then she was in his arms \\nso quickly that their bodies came together in one line of \\nsilken electricity and he finaUy had his arms aroimd her, was \\nkissing her warm mouth deeply, was crushing her body and \\nbreasts against him and then rolling his body on top of \\nhers. \\n\\nHer flesh and hair, taut silk, now she was all eagerness, \\nsurging against him wildly in a virginal erotic frenzy. When \\nhe entered her she gave a little gasp and was still for just a \\nsecond and then in a powerful forward thrust of her pelvis she \\nlocked her satiny legs around his hips. When they came to the \\nend they were locked together so fiercely, straining against \\n\\n\\n347 \\n\\n\\n\\neach other so violently, that idling away from each othet was \\nlike the tremble before death. \\n\\nThat night and the weeks that followed, Michael Corleone \\ncame to understand the premium put on virginity by socially \\nprimitive people. It was a period of sensuality that he had never \\nbefore experienced, a sensuality mixed with a feeling of mas- \\nculine power. Apollonia in those hrst days became almost his \\nslave. Given trust, given affection, a young fiiU-blooded girl \\naroused from virginity to erotic awareness was as delicious as \\nan exactly ripe fruit. \\n\\nShe on her part brightened up the rather gloomy masculine \\natmosphere of the villa. She had packed her mother off the \\nvery next day after her bridal night and presided at the com- \\nmunal table with bright girlish charm. Don Tommasino dined \\nwith them every night and Dr Taza told aU his old stories as \\nthey drank wine in the garden full of statues garlanded with \\nblood -red flowers, and so the evenings passed pleasantly \\nenough. At night in their bedroom the newly married couple \\nspent hours of feverish lovemaking. Michael could not get \\nenough of Apollonia’s beautifully sculpted body, her honey- \\ncoloured skin, her huge brown eyes glowing with passion. \\nShe had a wonderfully fresh smell, a fleshly smeU perfumed by \\nher sex yet almost sweet and unbearably aphro^siacal. Her \\nvirginal passion matched his nuptial lust and often it was dawn \\nwhen they fell into an exhausted slumber. Sometimes, spent \\nbut not yet ready for sleep, Michael sat on the window ledge \\nand stared at Apollonia’s naked body while she slept. Her face \\ntoo was lovely in repose, a perfect face he had seen before only \\nin art books of painted Italian Madonnas who by no stretch of \\nthe artist’s skill could be thought virginal. \\n\\n\\' In the first week of their marriage they went on picnics and \\nsmaU trips in the Alfa Romeo. But then Don Tommasino took \\nMichael aside and explained that the marriage had made his \\npresence and identity common knowledge in that part of \\nSicily and precautions had to be taken against the enemies of \\nthe Corleone Family, whose long arms also stretched to this island \\nrefuge. Don Tommasino put armed guards around his villa \\nand the two shepherds, Calo and Fabrmio, were fixtures inside \\nthe walls. So Michael and his wife had to remain on the villa \\n\\n548 \\n\\n\\n\\ngrounds. Michael passed the time by teaching Apollonia to \\nread and write English and to drive the car along the inner \\nwalls of the villa. About this time Don Tommasino seemed to \\nbe preoccupied and poor company, he was stiU having trouble \\nwi^ the new Mafia in the town of Palermo, Dr Taza said. \\n\\nOne night in the garden an old village woman who worked \\nin the house as a servant brought a dish of fresh olives and \\nthen turned to Michael and said, ‘ Is it true what everybody is \\nsaying that you are the son of Don Corleone in New York \\nCity, the Godfather?* \\n\\nMichael saw Don Tommasino shaking his head in disgust \\nat the general knowledge of their secret. But the old crone was \\nlooking at him in so concerned a fashion, as if it was important \\nfor her to know the truth, that Michael nodded. \\'Do you know \\nmy father?’ he asked. \\n\\n\\'pie woman’s name was Filomena and her face was as \\nwrinkled and brown as a walnut, her brown^stained teeth \\nshowing through the shell of her flesh. For the first time since \\nhe had been in the villa she smiled at him. \\'The Godfather \\nsaved my life once,’ she said, \\'and my brains too.’ She made \\na gesture towards her head. \\n\\nShe obviously wanted to say something else so Michael \\nsmiled to encourage her. She asked almost fearfully, \\' Is it true \\nthat Luca Brasi is dead?’ \\n\\nMichael nodded again and was surprised at the look of \\nrelease on the old woman’s face. Filomena crossed herself and \\nsaid, ‘God forgive me, but may his soul roast in hell for eter- \\nnity.’ \\n\\n]^chael remembered his old curiosity about Brasi, and had \\nthe sudden intuition that this woman knew the story Hagen \\nand Sonny had refused to tell him. He poured the woman a \\nglass of wine and made her sit down. ‘ Tell me about my father \\nand Luca Brasi,’ he said gently. \\'I know some of it, but how \\ndid they become friends and why was Brasi so devoted to my \\nfather? Don’t be afraid, come tell me.* \\n\\nFilomena’s wrinkled face, her raisin-black eyes, turned to \\nDon Tommasino, who in some way signalled his permission. \\nAnd so Filomena passed the evening for them by telling her \\nstory. \\n\\n\\nH9 \\n\\n\\n\\nThirty years before, Filomena had been a midwife in New \\nYork Qty, on Tenth Avenue, servicing the Italian colony. \\nThe women were always pregnant and she prospered. She \\ntaught doctors a few things when they tried to interfere in a \\ndifficult birth. Her husband was then a prosperous grocery \\nstore owner, dead now\\' poor soul, she blessed him, though he \\nhad been a card player and wcnchcr who never thought to put \\naside for hard times. In any event one cursed night thirty \\nyears ago when all honest people were long in their beds, there \\ncame a knocking on Filomena’s door. She was by no means \\nfrightened, it was the quiet hour babes prudently chose to \\nenter safely into this sinful world, and so she dressed and \\nopened the door. Outside it was Luca Brasi whose reputation \\neven then was fearsome. It was known also that he was a \\nbachelor. And so Filomena was immediately frightened. She \\nthought he had come to do her husband harm, that perhaps \\nher husband had foolishly refused Brasi some smaU favour. \\n\\nBut Brasi had come on the usual errand. He told Filomena \\nthat there was a woman about to give birth, that the house \\nwas out of the neighbourhood some distance away and that \\nshe was to come with him. Filomena immediately sensed some- \\nthing was amiss. Brasi’s brutal face looked almost like that of a \\nmadman that night, he was obviously in the grip of some \\ndemon. She tried to protest that she attended only women \\nwhose history she knew but he shoved a handful of green \\ndollars in her hand and ordered her roughly to come along \\nwith him. She was too frightened to refuse. \\n\\nIn the street was a Ford, its driver of the same feather as \\nLuca Brasi. The drive was no more than thirty minutes to a \\nsmall frame house in Long Island City right over the bridge. A \\ntwo-family house but obviously now tenanted only by Brasi \\nand his gang. For there were some other ruffians in the kitchen \\nplaying cards and drinking. Brasi took Filomena up the stairs to \\na bedroom. In the bed was a young pretty girl who looked Irish, \\nher face painted, her hair red; and with a belly swollen like a \\nsow. The poor girl was so frightened. When she saw Brasi she \\nturned her head away in terror, yes terror, and indeed the look \\nof hatred on Brasi’s evil face was the most frightening thing she \\nhad ever seen in her life. (Here Filomena crossed herself again.) \\n\\n\\n350 \\n\\n\\n\\nTo make a long story short, Btasi left the room. Two <^his \\nmen assisted the midwife and the baby was bom, the mother \\nwas exhausted and went into a deep sleep. Brasi was sum- \\nmoned and Filomena, who had wrapped the newborn child \\nin an extra blanket, extended the bun^e to him and said, ‘ If \\nyou’re the father, take her. My work is finished.’ \\n\\nBrasi glared at her, malevolent, insanity stamped on his face. \\n‘Yes, I’m the father,* he said. *But I don’t want any of that \\nrace to live. Take it down to the basement and throw it into \\nthe furnace.’ \\n\\nFor a moment Filomena thought she had not understood \\nhim properly. She was puazled by his use of the word ‘race’. \\nDid he mean because the girl was not Italian ? Or did he mean \\nbecause the girl was obviously of the lowest type; a whore in \\nshort ? Or did he mean that anything springing from his loins \\nhe forbade to live. And then she was sure he was making a \\nbrutal joke. She said shortly, *It*s your child, do what you \\nwant.’ And she tried to hand him the btmdle. \\n\\nAt this time the exhausted mother awoke and turned on her \\nside to face them. She was just in time to see Brasi thrust vio- \\nlently at the btindJe, crushing the newborn infant against Filo- \\nmena’s chest. She called out weakly, ‘ Luc, Luc, I’m sorry,’ and \\nBrasi turned to face her. \\n\\nIt was terrible, Filomena said now. So terrible. They were \\nlike two mad animals. They were not human. The hatred they \\nbore each other blazed through the room. Nothing else, not \\neven the newborn infant, existed for them at that moment. \\nAnd yet there was a strange passion. A bloody, demonical lust \\nso unnatural you knew they were damned forever. Then Luca \\nBrasi turned back to Filomena and said harshly,* ‘Do what I \\ntell you. I’ll make you rich.’ \\n\\nFilomena could not speak in her terror. She shook her head. \\nFinally she managed to whisper, ‘You do it, you’re the father, \\ndo it if you like.’ But Brasi didn’t answer. Instead he drew a \\nknife from inside his shirt. ‘I’ll cut your throat,* he said. \\n\\nShe must have gone into shock then because the next thing \\nshe remembered they were all standing in the basement of the \\nhouse in front of a square iron furnace, Filomena was stiU \\nholding the blanketed baby, which had not made a sound. \\n\\n\\n35 * \\n\\n\\n\\n(Maybe if it had cried, maybe if I had been shrewd enough to \\npinch it, Filomena said, that monster would have shown \\nmercy.) \\n\\nOne of the men must have opened the furnace door, the fire \\nnow was visible. And then she was alone with Brasi in that \\nbasement with its sweating pipes, its mousy odour. Brasi had \\nhis knife out again. And ^cre could be no doubting that he \\nwould kill her. There were the flames, there were Brasi*s eyes. \\nHis face was the gargoyle of the devil, it was not human, it was \\nnot sane. He pushed her towards the open furnace door. \\n\\nAt this point, Filomena fell silent. She folded her bony \\nhands in her lap and looked directly at Michael. He knew what \\nshe wanted, how she wanted to tell him, without using her \\nvoice. He asked gently, ‘Did you do it?’ She nodded. \\n\\nIt was only after another glass of wine and crossing herself \\nand muttering a prayer that she continued her story. She was \\ngiven a bundle of money and driven home. She understood \\nthat if she uttered a word about what had happened she would \\nbe killed. But two days later Brasi murdered the young Irish \\ngirl, the mother of the infant, and was arrested by the police. \\nFilomena, frightened out of her wits, went to the Godfather \\nand told her story. He ordered her to keep silent, that he would \\nattend to everything. At that time Brasi did not work for Don \\nQirleone. \\n\\nBefore Don Corleone could set matters right, Luca Brasi \\ntried to commit suicide in his cell, hacking at ^s throat with a \\npiece of glass. He was transferred to the prison hospital and by \\nthe time he recovered Don Corleone had arranged everything. \\nThe police did not have a case they could prove in court and \\nLuca Brasi was released. \\n\\nThough Don Corleone assured Filomena that she had \\nnotiling to fear from either Luca Brasi or the police, she had \\nno peace. Her nerves were shattered and she could no longer \\nwork at her profession. Finally she persuaded her husband to \\nsell the grocery store and they returned to Italy. Her husband \\nwas a good man, had been told everything and understood. \\nBut he was a weak man and in Italy squandered the fortune \\nthey had both slaved in America to earn. And so after he died \\nshe had become a servant So Filomena ended her story. She \\n\\n\\n53 * \\n\\n\\n\\nhad another glass of wine and said to Michael, *1 bless the \\nname of your father. He always sent me money when I asked, \\nhe saved me from Brasi. Tell him I say a prayer for his soul \\nevery night and that he shouldn’t fear dying.’ \\n\\nAfter she had left, Michael asked Don Tommasino, Ts her \\nstory true?’ The capo-mafioso nodded. And Michael thought, \\nno wonder nobody had wanted to tell him the story. Some \\nstory. Some Luca. \\n\\nThe next morning Michael wanted to discuss the whole \\nthing with Don Tommasino but learned that the old man had \\nbeen called to Palermo by an urgent message delivered by a \\ncourier. That evening Don Tommasino returned and took \\nMichael aside. News had come from America, he said. News \\nthat it grieved him to tell. Santino Corleone had been killed. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR \\n\\nThe Sicilian sun, early-morning lemon-coloured, filled \\nMichael’s bedroom. He awoke and, feeling Apollonia’s satiny \\nbody against his own sleep-warm skin, made her come awake \\nwith love. When they were done, even all the months of com- \\nplete possession could not stop him from marvelling at her \\nbeauty and her passion. \\n\\nShe left the bedroom to wash and dress in the bathroom \\ndown the hall. Michael, still naked, the morning sun refreshing \\nbis body, lit a cigarette and relaxed on the bed. This was the \\nlast morning they would spend in this house and the villa. Don \\nTommasino had arranged for him to be transferred to another \\ntown on the southern coast of Sicily. Apollonia, in the first \\nmonth of pregnancy, wanted to visit with her family for a \\nfew weeks and would join him at the new hiding place after \\nthe visit. \\n\\nThe night before, Don Tommasino had sat with Michael in \\nthe garden after Apollonia had gone to bed. The Don had been \\nworried and tired, and admitted that he was concerned about \\nMichael’s safety. *Your marriage brought you into sight,’ he \\n\\n353 \\n\\n\\n^ Godfittber — 12 \\n\\n\\n\\ntold Michael. \\'Fm surprised your father hasn’t made arrange- \\nments for you to go some place else. In any case Fm having my \\nown troubles with the young Turks in Palermo. Fve offered \\nsome fair arrangements so that they can wet their beaks more \\nthan they deserve, but those scum want everything. T can’t \\nunderstand their attitude. They’ve tried a few little tricks but \\nFm not so easy to kill. They must know Fm too strong for \\nthem to hold me so cheaply. But that’s the trouble with young \\npeople, no matter how talented. They don’t reason things out \\nand they want all the water in the well.’ \\n\\nAnd then Don Tommasino had told Michael that the two \\nshepherds, Fabrizaio and Calo, would go with him as body- \\nguards in the Alfa Romeo. Don Tommasino would say his \\ngoodbyes tonight since he would be off early in the morning, \\nat dawn, to see to his affairs in Palermo. Also, Michael was not \\nto tell Dr Taza about the move, since the doctor planned to \\nspend the evening in Palermo and might blab. \\n\\nMichael had known Don lommasino was in trouble. \\nArmed guards patrolled the walls of the villa at night and a \\nfew faithful shepherds with their luparas were always in the \\nhouse. Don Tommasino himself went heavily armed and a \\npersonal bodyguard attended him at all times. \\n\\nThe morning sun was now too strong. Michael stubbed out \\nhis cigarette and put on work pants, work shirt, and the peaked \\ncap most Sicilian men wore. Still barefooted, he leaned out his \\nbedroom window and saw Fabrizzio sitting in one of the \\ngarden chairs. Fabrizzio was lazily combing his thick dark hair, \\nhis lupara was carelessly thrown across the garden table. \\nMichael whistled and Fabrizzio looked up to his window. \\n\\n‘ Get the car,’ Michael called down to him. ‘ Fll be leaving in \\nfive minutes. Where’s Calo?’ \\n\\nFabrizzio stood up. His shirt was open, exposing the blue \\nand red lines of the tattoo on his chest. ‘ Calo is having a cup of \\ncoffee in the kitchen,’ Fabrizzio said, ‘Is your wife coming \\nwith you?’ \\n\\nMichael squinted down at him. It occurred to him that Fab- \\nrizzio had been following Apollonia too much with his eyes \\nthe last few weeks. Not that he would dare ever to make an \\nadvance towards the wife of a friend of the Don’s. In Sicily \\n\\n\\n354 \\n\\n\\n\\nthere was no surer road to death. Michael said coldly, *No, \\nshe’s going to her family first, she’U join us in a few days.* He \\nwatched Fabthczio hurry into the stone hut that served as a \\ngarage for the Alfa Romeo. \\n\\nMichael went down the hall to wash. Apollonia was gone. \\nShe was most likely in the kitchen preparing his breakfast with \\nher own hands to wash out the milt sh^ felt because she wanted \\nto see her family one more timcT>cfore going so far away to the \\nother end of Sicily. Don Tommasino would arrange trans- \\nportation for her to where Michael would be. \\n\\nDown in the kitchen the old woman Fdomena brought him \\nhis coffee and shyly bid him a goodbye. ‘FU remember you to \\nmy father,’ Michael said and she nodded. \\n\\nCalo came into the kitchen and said to Michael, * The car’s \\noutside, shall I get your bag?’ \\n\\n*No, FU get it,’ Michael said. ‘Where’s ApoUa?’ \\n\\nCalo’s face broke into an amused grin. ‘ She’s sitting in the \\ndriver’s seat of the car, dying to step on the gas. She’ll be a \\nreal American woman before she gets to America.’ It was un- \\nheard of for one of the peasant women in Sicily to attempt \\ndriving a car. But Michael sometimes let Apollonia guide the \\nAlfa Romeo around the inside of the villa walls, always beside \\nher however because she sometimes stepped on the gas when \\nshe meant to step on the brake. \\n\\nMichael said to Gilo, * Get Fabri22io and wait for me in the \\ncar.’ He went out of the kitchen and ran up the stairs to the \\nbedroom. His bag was already packed. Before picking it up he \\nlooked out the window and saw the car parked in front of the \\nportico steps rather than the kitchen entrance. Apollonia was \\nsitting in the car, her hands on the wheel like a child playing. \\nCalo was just putting the lunch basket in the rear seat. And \\nthen Michael was annoyed to see Fabrizzio disappearing \\nthrough the gates of the villa on some errand outside. What \\nthe hell was he doing? He saw Fabrizzio take a look over his \\nshoulder, a look that was somehow furtive. He’d have to \\nstraighten that damn shepherd out. Michael went down the \\nstairs and decided to go through the kitchen to see Filomena \\nagain and give her a final farewell. He asked the old woman, \\n‘Is Dr Taza still sleeping?’ \\n\\n\\n555 \\n\\n\\n\\nFilomena’s wrinkled face was sly. ‘ Old roosters can’t greet \\nthe sun. The doctor went to Palermo last night.’ \\n\\nMichael laughed. He went out the kitchen entrance and the \\nsmell of lemon blossoms penetrated even his sinus-filled nose. \\nHe saw Apollonia wave to him from the car just ten paces up \\nthe villa’s driveway and then he realized she was motioning \\nhim to stay where he was, that she meant to drive the car to \\nwhere he stood. Calo stood grfnning beside the car, his lupara \\ndangling in his hand. But there was still no sign of Fabrizzio. \\nAt that moment, without any conscious reasoning process, \\neverything came together in his mind, and Michael shouted \\nto the girl, ‘Nol No! ’ But his shout was drowned in the roar \\nof the tremendous explosion as Apollonia switched on the \\nignition. The kitchen door shattered into fragments and \\nMichael was hurled along the wall of the villa for a good ten \\nfeet. Stones tumbling from the villa roof hit him on the \\nshoulders and one glanced off his skull as he was lying on the \\nground. He was conscious just long enough to see that nothing \\nremained of the Alfa Romeo but its four wheels and the steel \\nshafts which held them together. \\n\\nHe came to consciousness in a room that seemed very dark \\nand heard voices that were so low that they were pure sound \\nrather than words. Out of animal instinct he tried to pretend \\nhe was still unconscious but the voices stopped and someone \\nwas leaning from a chair close to his bed and the voice was \\ndistinct now, saying, ‘Well, he’s with us finaUy,’ A lamp went \\non, its light like white fire on his eyeballs and Michael turned \\nhis head. It felt very heavy, numb. And then he could sec the \\nface over his bed was that of Dr Taza. \\n\\n‘Let me look at you a minute and I’ll put the light out,’ Dr \\nTaza said gently. He was busy shining a small pencil flasl^ght \\ninto Michael’s eyes. ‘You’ll be all right,’ Dr Taza said and \\nturned to someone else in the room. ‘You can speak to him.* \\n\\nIt was Don Tommasino sitting on a chair near his bed, \\nMichael could sec him clearly now. Don Tommasino was say- \\ning, ‘Michael, Michael, can I talk to you? Do you want to \\nrest?’ \\n\\nIt was easier to raise a hand to make a gesture and Michael \\n\\n356 \\n\\n\\n\\ndid so and Don Tonunasino said, *Did Fabriazio bring the car \\nfrom the garage?* \\n\\nMichael, without knowing he did so, smiled. It was in some \\nstrange way, a chilling smile, of assent. Don Tommasino said, \\n‘Fabrizzio has vanished. Listen to me, Michael. You’ve been \\nunconscious for nearly a week. Do you understand? Every- \\nbody thinks you’re dead, so you’re safe now, they’ve stopped \\nlooldng for you. I’ve sent messages to your father and he’s sent \\nback instructions. It won’t be long now, you’ll be back in \\nAmerica. Meanwhile you’ll rest here quietly. You’re safe up \\nin the mountains, in a special frrmhouse I own. The Palermo \\npeople have made their peace with me now that you’re sup- \\nposed to be dead, so it was you they were after all the time. \\nThey wanted to kill you while making people think it was me \\nthey were after. That\\'s something you should know. As for \\neverything else, leave it all to me. You recover your strength \\nand be tranquil.’ \\n\\nMichael was remembering everything now. He knew his \\nwife was dead, that Calo was dead. He thought of the old \\nwoman in the kitchen. He couldn’t remember if she had come \\noutside with him. He whispered, ‘Filomena?’ Don Tomma- \\nsino said quietly, ^She wasn’t hurt, just a bloody nose from the \\nblast. Don’t worry about her.’ \\n\\nMichael said, * Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know that the \\none who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in \\nSicily.’ \\n\\nBoth men seemed to sigh with relief. Don Tommasino lifted \\na glass from a nearby table and drank from it an amber fluid \\nthat jolted his head up. Dr Taza sat on the bed and said almost \\nabsently, ‘ You know, you’re a widower. That’s rare in Sicily. ’ \\nAs if the distinction might comfort him. \\n\\nMichael motioned to Don Tommasino to lean closer. The \\nDon sat on the bed and bent his head. * Tell my father to get me \\nhome,’ Michael said. *Tcll my father I wish to be his son.’ \\n\\nBut it was to be another month before Michael recovered \\nfrom his injuries and another two months after that before all \\nthe necessary papers and arrangements were ready. Then he \\nwas flown from Palermo to Rome and from Rome to New \\nYork. In all that time no trace had been found of Fabrizzio. \\n\\n\\n• 557 \\n\\n\\n\\nBook VII \\n\\n\\nCHAPTKR TWENTY-FIVE \\n\\nWhen Kay Adams received her college degree, she took a \\njob teacliing grade school in her New Hampshire hometown. \\nThe first six months after Michael vanished she made weekly \\ntelephone calls to his mother asking about him. Mrs Corlconc \\nwas always friendly and always wound up saying, ‘You a very \\nvery nice girl. You forget about Mikey and find a nice hus- \\nband.’ Kay was not offended at her bluntness and understood \\nthat the mother spoke out of concern for her as a young girl \\nin an impossible situation. \\n\\nWhen her first school term ended, she decided to go to New \\nYork to buy some decent clothes and sec some old coUege girl- \\nfriends. She thought also about looking for some sort of in- \\nteresting job in New York. She had lived like a spinster for \\nalmost two years, reading and teaching, refusing dates, refusing \\nto go out at all, even though she had given up making calls \\nto Long Beach. She knew she couldn’t keep that up, she was \\nbecoming irritable and unhappy. But she had always believed \\nMichael would write her or send her a message of some sort. \\nThat he had not done so humiliated her, it saddened her that \\nhe was so distrustful even of her. \\n\\nShe took an early train and was checked into her hotel by \\nmid-<afternoon. Her girlfriends worked and she didn’t want \\nto bother them at their jobs, she planned to call them at night. \\nAnd she didn’t really feel like going shopping after the ex- \\nhausting train trip. Being alone in the hotd room, remember- \\ning all the times she and Michael had used hotel rooms to \\nmake love, gave her a feeling of desolation. It was that more \\nthan anything else that gave her the idea of calling Michaers \\nmother out in Long Beach. \\n\\nThe phone was answered by a rough masculine voice with a \\ntypical, to her. New York accent. Kay asked to speak to Mrs \\n\\n55 « \\n\\n\\n\\nCorleone. There was a few minutes* silence and then Kay heard \\nthe heavily accented voice asking who it was. \\n\\nKay was a little embarrassed now. * This is Kay Adams, Mrs \\nCorleone,’ she said. *Do you remcmbei me?’ \\n\\n‘Sure, sure, I remember you,’ Mrs Corleone said. ‘How \\ncome you no caU up no more? You get a married?’ \\n\\n‘Oh, no,’ Kay said, ‘I’ve been busy.’ She was surprised at \\nthe mother obviously being annoyed that she had stopped \\ncalling. ‘Have you heard anything from Michael? Is he all \\nright?’ \\n\\nThere was silence at the other end of the phone and then \\nMrs Corleone’s voice came strong. ‘Mikey is at home. He no \\ncaU you up? He no see you?* \\n\\nKay felt her stomach go weak from shock and a humiliating \\ndesire to weep. Her voice broke a little when she asked, ‘ How \\nlong has he been home?* \\n\\nMrs Corleone said, ‘Six months.’ \\n\\n‘Oh, I see,’ Kay said. And she did. She felt hot waves of \\nshame that Michael’s mother knew he was treating her so \\ncheaply. And then she was angry. Angry at Michael, at his \\nmother, angry at all foreigners, Italians who didn’t have the \\ncommon courtesy to keep up a decent show of friendship even \\nif a love affair was over. Didn’t Michael know she would be \\nconcerned for him as a friend even if he no longer wanted her \\nfor a bed companion, even if he no longer wanted to marry \\nher? Did he think she was one of those poor benighted \\nItalian girls who would commit suicide or make a scene after \\ngiving up her virgiruty and then being thrown over? But she \\nkept her voice as cool as possible. ‘I see, thank you very \\nmuch,’ she said. * I’m glad Michael is home again knd all right. \\nI just wanted to know. I won’t call you again.’ \\n\\nMrs Corleone’s voice came impatiently over the phone as if \\nshe had heard nothing that Kay had said. ‘You wanta see \\nMikey, you come out here now. Give him a nice surprise. You \\ntake a taxi, and I tell the man at the gate to pay the taxi for you. \\nYou tell the taxi man he get two times his clock, otherwise he \\nno come way out the Long Beach. But don’t you pay. My \\nhusband’s man at the gate pay the taxi.’ \\n\\n‘1 couldn’t do that, Mrs Corleone,* Kay said coldly. *lf \\n\\n359 \\n\\n\\n\\nMichael wanted to see me, he would have called me at home \\nbefore this. Obviously he doesn\\'t want to resume our rela- \\ntionship.’ \\n\\nMrs Corleone’s voice came briskly over the phone. ‘You a \\nvery nice girl, you gotta nice legs, but you no gotta much \\nbrains.\\' She chuckled. ‘You come out to see me, not Mikey. \\nI wanta talk to you. You come right now. An’ no pay the taxi. \\nI wait for you.* The phone clicked. Mrs Corlconc had hung \\nup. \\n\\nKay could have called back and said she wasn’t coming but \\nshe knew she had to see Michael, to talk to him, even if it was \\njust polite talk. If he was home now, openly, that meant he \\nwas no longer in trouble, he could live normally. She jumped \\noff the bed and started to get ready to see him. She took a great \\ndeal of care with her makeup and dress. When she was ready \\nto leave she stared at her reflection in the mirror. Was she \\nbetter-looking than when Michael had disappeared? Or would \\nhe find her unattractively older? Her figure had become more \\nwomanly, her hips rounder, her breasts fuller, Italians liked \\nthat supposedly, though Michael had always said he loved her \\nbeing so thin. It didn’t matter really, Michael obviously didn’t \\nwant anything to do with her any more, otherwise he most \\ncertainly would have called in the six months he had been \\nhome. \\n\\nThe taxi she hailed refused to take her to Long Beach until \\nshe gave him a pretty smile and told him she would pay double \\nthe meter. It was nearly an hour’s ride and the mall in Long \\nBeach had changed since she last saw it. There were iron \\nfences around it and an iron gate barred the mall entrance. A \\nmap wearing slacks and a white jacket over a red shirt opened \\nthe gate, poked his head into the cab to read the meter and \\ngave the cab driver some bills. Then when Kay saw the driver \\nwas not protesting and was happy with the money paid, she \\ngot out and walked across the m\\'aU to the central house. \\n\\nMrs Corleone herself opened the door and greeted Kay with \\na warm embrace that surprised her. Then she surveyed Kay \\nwith an appraising eye. ‘You a beautiful girl,* she said flatly. \\n‘I have stupid sons.’ She pulled Kay inside the door and led \\nher to the Idtchen, where a platter of foocf was already set out \\n\\n560 \\n\\n\\n\\nand a pot of coffee perked on the stove. ‘Michael comes home \\npretty soon,^ she said. ‘You surprise him.* \\n\\nThey sat down together and the old woman forced Kay to \\ncat, meanwhile asking questions with great curiosity. She was \\ndelighted that Kay was a schoolteacher and that she had come \\nto New York to visit old girlfriends and that Kay was oniy \\ntwenty -four years old. She kept nodding her head as if all the \\nfacts accorded wnth some private specifications in her mind. \\nKay was so nervous that she just answered the questions, \\nnever saying anything else. \\n\\nShe saw him first through the kitchen window. A car pulled \\nup in front of the house and two other men got out. Then \\nMichael. He straightened up to talk with one of the other men. \\nHis profile, the left one, was exposed to her view. It was \\ncracked, indented, like the plastic face of a doll that a child \\nhas wantonly kicked. In a curious way it did not mar his hand- \\nsomeness in her eyes but moved her to tears. She saw him put \\na snow-white handkerchief to his mouth and nose and hold it \\nthere for a moment while he turned away to come into the \\nhouse. \\n\\nShe heard the door open and his footsteps in the hall turning \\ninto the kitchen and then he was in the open space, seeing her \\nand his mother. He seemed impassive, and then he smiled ever \\nso slightly, the broken half of his face halting the widening of \\nhis mouth. And Kay, who had meant just to say ‘Hello, how \\narc you,\\' in the coolest possible way, slipped out of her seat \\nto run into his arms, bury her face against his shoulder. He \\nkissed her wet cheek and held her until she finished weeping \\nand then he walked her out to his car, waved hifi bodyguard \\naway and drove off with her beside him, she repairing her \\nmakeup by simply wiping what was left of it away with her \\nhandkerchief. \\n\\n‘I never meant to do that,\\' Kay said. ‘It’s just that nobody \\ntold me how badly they hurt you.\\' \\n\\nMichael laughed and touched the broken side of his face. \\n* You mean this? That’s nothing. Just gives me sinus trouble. \\nNow that I\\'m home I\\'ll probably get it fixed. I couldn’t write \\nyou or anything,\\' Michael said. ‘ You have to understand that \\nbefore anything else.\\' \\n\\n\\n561 \\n\\n\\n\\n‘OK/ she said. \\n\\n‘ Tve got a place in the city/ Michael said. \\' Is it all right if we \\ngo there or should it be dinner and drinks at a restaurant?’ \\n\\n‘Tm not hungry/ Kay said. \\n\\nThey drove towards New York in silence for a while. ‘Did \\nyou get your degree?’ Michael asked. \\n\\n‘Yes/ Kay said. ‘I’m teaching grade school in my home- \\ntown now. Did they find the man who really killed the police- \\nman, is that why you were able to come home?’ \\n\\nFor a moment Michael didn’t answer. ‘Yes, they did,’ he \\nsaid. ‘ It was in aU the New York papers. Didn’t you read about \\nit?’ \\n\\nKay laughed with the relief of him denying he was a mur- \\nderer. ‘We only get the New York Tmes up in our town,’ she \\nsaid. ‘I guess it was buried back in page eighty-nine. If I’d read \\nit I’d have called your mother sooner.’ She paused and then \\nsaid, ‘ It’s funny, the way your mother used to talk, I almost \\nbelieved you had done it. And just before you came, while we \\nwere drinking coffee, she told me about that crazy man who \\nconfessed.’ \\n\\nMichael said, ‘ Maybe my mother did believe it at first.* \\n\\n‘Your own mother?’ Kay asked. \\n\\nMichael grinned. ‘Mothers are like cops. They always be- \\nlieve the worst.* \\n\\nMichael parked the car in a garage on Mulberry Street where \\nthe owner seemed to know him. He took Kay around the \\ncorner to what looked like a fairly decrepit brownstone house \\nwhich fitted into the rundown neighbourhood. Michael had a \\nkey to the front door and when they went inside Kay saw that \\nit )vas as expensively and comfortably furnished as a million- \\naire’s town house. Michael led her to the upstairs apartment \\nwhich consisted of an enormous living room, a huge kitchen \\nand door that led to the bedroom. In one corner of the living \\nroom was a bar and Michael mixed them both a drink. They \\nsat on a sofa together and Michael said quietly, ‘ We might as \\nwell go into the bedroom.* Kay took a long pull from her \\ndrink and smiled at him. ‘ Yes/ she said. \\n\\nFor Kay the lovemaking was almost like it had been before \\nexcept that Michael was rougher, more direct, not as tender \\n\\n562 \\n\\n\\n\\nas he had been. As if he weie on guard against her. But she \\ndidn’t want to complain. It would wear ofF. In a funny way» \\nmen were more sensitive in a situation like this, she thought. \\nShe had found making love to Michael after a two-year ab- \\nsence the most natural thing in the world. It was as if he had \\nnever been away. \\n\\n\\'You could have written me, you could have trusted me/ \\nshe said, nestling against his body. \\' 1 would have practised the \\nNew England omerta. Yankees are pretty closemouthed too, \\nyou know.’ \\n\\nMichael laughed sofitly in the darkness. \\'I never figured you \\nto be waiting,’ he said. *I never figured you to wait after what \\nhappened.’ \\n\\nKay said quickly, ‘I never believed you killed those two \\nmen. Except mayl^ when your mother seemed to think so. \\nBut I never believed it in my heart. I know you too well.’ \\n\\nShe could hear Michael give a sigh. ^It doesn’t matter \\nwhether I did or not,’ he said. * You have to understand that.’ \\n\\nKay was a little stuimed by the coldness in his voice. She \\nsaid, *So just tell me now, did you or didn’t you?’ \\n\\nMichael sat up on his pillow and in the darkness a light \\nflared as he got a cigarette going. * If I asked you to marry me, \\nwould I have to answer that question first before you’d give \\nme an answer to mine?’ \\n\\nKay said, * I don’t care, I love you, I don’t care. If you loved \\nme you wouldn’t be afraid to tell me the truth. You wouldn’t \\nbe airraid I might tell the police. That’s it, isn’t it? You’re really \\na gangster then, isn’t that so? But I really don’t care. What I \\ncare about is that you obviously don’t love me. You didn’t \\neven call me up when you got back home.’ \\n\\nMichael was puffing on his cigarette and some burning ashes \\nfell on Kay’s bare back. She flinched a little and said jokingly, \\n‘Stop torturing me, I won’t talk.’ \\n\\nMichael didn’t laugh. His voice sounded absentminded. \\n‘ You know, when I came home I wasn’t that glad when I saw \\nmy family, my father, my mother, my sister Connie, and Tom. \\nIt was nice but I didn’t really give a damn. Then 1 came home \\ntonight and saw you in the kitchen and I was glad. Is that what \\nyou mean by love?’ \\n\\n\\n5^5 \\n\\n\\n\\n‘ That*s dose enough for me/ Kay said. \\n\\nThey made love again for a while. Michael was more tender \\nthis time. And then he went out to get them both a drink. \\nWhen he came back he sat on an armchair fadng the bed* \\n‘Lct\\\\s get serious/ he said. ‘How do you feel about marrying \\nme?\\' Kay smiled at him and motioned him into the bed. \\nMichael smiled back at her. ‘Be serious/ he said. ‘I can’t tell \\nyou about anything that happened. I’m working for my father \\nnow. I’m being trained to take over the family olive oil busi- \\nness. But you know my family has enemies, my father has \\nenemies. You might be a very young widow, there’s a chance, \\nnot much of a one, but it could happen. And I won’t be telling \\nyou what happened at the office every day. I won’t be telling \\nyou anything about my Inisiness. You’ll be my wife but you \\nwon’t be my partner in life, as I think they say. Not an equal \\npartner. That can’t be.’ \\n\\nKay sat up in bed. She switched on a huge lamp standing on \\nthe night table and then she lit a cigarette. She leaned back on \\nthe pillows and said quietly, ‘You’re telling me you’re a \\ngangster, isn’t that it? You’re telling me that you’re respon- \\nsible for people being killed and other sundry crimes related \\nto murder. And that I’m not ever to ask about that part of \\nyour life, not even to tliink about it. Just like in the horror \\nmovies when the monster asks the beautiful girl to marry him.* \\nMichael grinned, the cracked part of his face turned tow^ards \\nher, and Kay said in contrition, ‘Oh, Mike, I don’t even notice \\nthat stupid thing, 1 swear I don’t.’ \\n\\n* I know,’ Michael said lauglung. ‘ I like having it now except \\nthat it makes the snot drip out of my nose.’ \\n\\n^ You said be serious/ Kay went on. ‘ If we get married what \\nkind of a life am I supposed to lead? Like your mother, like \\nan Italian housewife with just the kids and home to take care \\nof? And what about if something happens? I suppose you \\ncould wind up in jail someday.’ \\n\\n‘No, that’s not possible,* Michael said. ‘Killed, yes; jail, \\nno.’ \\n\\nKay laughed at this confidence, it was a laugh that had a \\nfunny mixture of pride with its amusement. ‘But how can you \\nsay that?’ she said. ‘Really.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nMichael sighed. \\'These are all the things I can’t talk to you \\nabout, I don’t want to talk to you about.’ \\n\\nKay was silent for a long time. ‘Why do you want me to \\nmarry you after never calling me all these months? Am I so \\ngood in bed?’ \\n\\nMichael nodded gravely. ‘ Sure,* he said. * But I’m getting it \\nfor nothing so why should I marry you for that? Look, I don’t \\nwant an answer now. We’re going to keep seeing each other. \\nYou can talk it over with your parents. I hear your father is a \\nreal tough guy in his own way. Listen to his advice.’ \\n\\n‘You haven’t answered why, why you want to marry me,’ \\nKay said. \\n\\nMichael took a white handkerchief from the drawer of the \\nnight table and held it to his nose. He blew into it and then \\nwiped. ‘There’s the best reason for not marrying me,’ he said. \\n‘How would that be having a guy around who always has to \\nblow his nose?’ \\n\\nKay said impatiently, ‘Come on, be serious, I asked you a \\nquestion.’ \\n\\nMichael held the handkerchief in his hand. ‘OK,’ he said, \\n* this one time. You are the only person I felt any affection for, \\nthat I care about, I didn’t call you because it never occurred \\nto me that you’d still be interested in me after everything that’s \\nhappened. Sure, I could have chased you, I could have conned \\nyou, but I. didn’t want to do that. Now here’s something I’ll \\ntrust you with and I don’t want you to repeat it even to your \\nfather. If everything goes right, the Corleone Family will be \\ncompletely legitimate in about five years. Some very tricky \\nthings have to be done to make that possible. That’s when you \\nmay become a wealthy widow. Now what do I want you for? \\nWell, because I want you and I want a family. I want kids; it’s \\ntime. And I don’t want those k*ds to be influenced by me the \\nway I was influenced by my rather. I don’t mean my fathet \\ndeliberately influenced me. He never did. He never even \\nwanted me in the family business. He wanted me to become a \\nprofessor or a doctor, something like that. But things went \\nbad and I had to fight for my Family. I had to fight because 1 \\nlove and admire my father. J never knew a man more worthy \\nof respect. He was a good husband and a good father and a \\n\\n\\n\\ngood friend to people who were not so fortunate in life. There^s \\nanother side to him, but that’s not relevant to me as his son. \\nAnyway I don’t want that to happen to my kids. I want them \\nto be influenced by you. I want them to grow up to be All- \\nAmerican kids, real All-American, the whole works. Maybe \\nthey or their grandchildren will go into politics.’ Michael \\ngrinned. ‘Maybe one of them will be President of the United \\nStates. Why the heU not? In my history course at Dartmouth \\nwe did some background on all the Presidents and they had \\nfathers and grandfathers who were lucky they didn’t get \\nhanged. But I’ll settle for my kids being doctors or musicians \\nor teachers. They’ll never be in the Family business. By the \\ntime they arc that old I’ll be retired anyway. And you and I will \\nbe part of some country club crowd, the good simple life of \\nwell-to-do Americans. How does that strike you for a pro- \\nposition?’ \\n\\n‘Marvellous,’ Kay said. ‘But you sort of skipped over the \\nwidow part.’ \\n\\n‘There’s not much chance of that. T just mentioned it to give \\na fair presentation.* Michael patted his nose with the handker- \\nchief. \\n\\n‘ I can’t beUeve it, I can’t believe you’re a man like that, you’re \\njust not,’ Kay said. Her face had a bewildered look. ‘I just \\ndon’t understand the whole thing, how it could possibly be.’ \\n\\n‘Well, I’m not giving any more explanations,’ Michael said \\ngently. ‘You know, you don’t have to think about any of this \\nstuff, it has nothing to do with you really, or with out life \\ntogether if we get married.’ \\n\\nKay shook her head. ‘ How can you want to marry me, how \\ncan you hint that you love me, you never say the word but you \\nju^t now said you loved your father, you never said you loved \\nme, how could you if you distrust me so much you can’t tell \\nme about the most important things in your life ? How can you \\nwant to have a wife you can’t trust? Your father trusts your \\nmother. I know that.’ \\n\\n‘Sure,’ Michael said. ‘But that doesn’t mean he teUs her \\neverything. And, you know, he has reason to trust her. Not \\nbecause they got married and she’s his wife. But she bore him \\nfour children in times when it was not that safe to bear chil- \\n\\n366 \\n\\n\\n\\ndren. She nursed and guarded him when people shot him. She \\nbelieved in him. He was always her first loyalty for forty years. \\nAfter you do that maybe Fll tell you a few things you really \\ndon’t want to hear.’ \\n\\n‘Will we have to live in the mall?* Kay asked. \\n\\nMichael nodded. ‘We’ll have our own house, it won’t be so \\nbad. My parents don’t meddle. Our lives will be our own. But \\nuntil everything gets straightened out, I have to live in the \\nmall.’ \\n\\n‘ Because it’s dangerous for you to live outside it,’ Kay said. \\n\\nFor the first time since she had come to know him, she saw \\nMichael angry. It was cold chilling anger that was not ex- \\nternalised in any gesture or change in voice. It was a coldness \\nthat came off him like death and Kay knew that it was this \\ncoldness that would make her decide not to marry him if she \\nso decided. \\n\\n‘ The trouble is all that damn trash in the movies and’ the \\nnewspapers,’ Michael said. ‘You’ve got the wrong idea of my \\nfather and the Corleone Family. I’ll make a final explanation \\nand this one will be reaUy final. My father is a businessman \\ntrying to provide for his wife and children and those friends \\nhe might need someday in a time of trouble. He doesn’t accept \\nthe rules of the society we live in because those rules would \\nhave condemned him to a life not suitable to a man like him- \\nself, a man of extraordinary force and character. What you \\nhave to understand is that he considers himself the equal of aU \\nthose great men like Presidents and Prime Ministers and \\nSupreme Court Justices and Governors of the States. He \\nrefuses to accept their will over his own. He refuses to live by \\nrules set up by others, rules which condemn him to a \\ndefeated life. But his ultimate aim is to enter that society with \\na certain power since society doesn’t really protect its members \\nwho do not have their own individual power. In the meantime \\nhe operates on a code of ethics he considers far superior to the \\nlegal structures of society.’ \\n\\nKay was looking at him incredulously. ‘But that’s ridicu- \\nlous,’ she said. ‘What if everybody felt the same way? How \\ncould society ever function, we’d be back in the times of the \\ncavemen. Mike, you don’t believe what you’re saying, do you ? ’ \\n\\n367 \\n\\n\\n\\nMichael grinned at her. \\'I’m just telling you what my father \\nbelieves. I just want you to understand that whatever else he \\nis, he’s not irresponsible, or at least not in the society which he \\nhas created. He’s not a crazy machine-gunning mobster as you \\nseem to think. He’s a responsible man in his own way.’ \\n\\n‘And what do you believe?’ Kay asked quietly. \\n\\nMichael shrugged. ‘I believe in my family,’ he said. ‘I be- \\nlieve in you and the family we may have. I don’t trust society \\nto protect us, 1 have no intention of placing my fate in the \\nhands of men whose only qualihcation is that they managed \\nto con a block of people to vote for them. But that’s for now. \\nMy father’s time is done. The things he did can no longer be \\ndone except with a great deal of risk. Whether we like it or \\nnot the Corleone Family has to join that society. But when \\nthey do I’d like us to join it with plenty of our own power ; \\nthat is, money and own.-rship of other valuables. I’d like to \\nmake my children as secure as possible before they join that \\ngeneral destiny.’ \\n\\n‘But you volunteered to fight for your country, you were a \\nwar hero,* Kay said. ‘What happened to make you change?’ \\n\\nMichael said, ‘ This is really getting us no place. But maybe \\nTm just one of those real old-fashioned conservatives they \\ngrow up in your hometown. I take care of myself. Individual. \\nGovernments really don’t do much for their people, that’s what \\nit comes down to, but that’s not it really. All I can say, T have \\nto help my father, I have to be on his side. And you have to \\nmake your decision about being on my side.’ He smiled at her. \\n‘ I guess getting married was a bad idea.’ \\n\\nKay patted the bed. ‘ I don’t know about marrying, but I’ve \\ngone without a man for two years and I’m not letting you off \\nso easy now. Come on in here.’ \\n\\nWhen they were in bed together, the light out, she whis- \\npered to him, ‘Do you believe me about not having a man \\nsince you left?’ \\n\\n‘ I believe you,’ Michael said. \\n\\n‘Did you?’ she whispered in a softer voice. \\n\\n‘Yes,’ Michael said. He felt her stiffen a little. ‘But not in \\nthe last six months.’ It was true. Kay was the first woman he \\nhad made love to since the death of ApoUonia. \\n\\n568 \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX \\n\\n\\nThe garish suite overlooked the fake fairyland grounds in \\nthe rear of the hotel ; transplanted palm trees lit up by climbers \\nof orange lights, two huge swimming pools shimmering dark \\nblue by the light of the desert stars. On the horizon were the \\nsand and stone mountains that ringed Las Vegas nestling in its \\nneon valley. Johnny Fontane let the heavy, richly embroidered \\ngrey drape fall and turned back to the room. \\n\\nA special detail of four men, a pit boss, a dealer, extra relief \\nman, and a cocktail waitress in her scanty nightclub costume \\nwere getting things ready for private action. Nino Valenti was \\nlying on the sofa in the living room part of the suite, a water \\nglass of whisky in his hand. He watched the people from the \\ncasino setting up the blackjack table with the proper six \\npadded chairs around its horseshoe outer rim. \"That*s great, \\nthat’s great/ he said in a slurred voice that was not quite \\ndrunken. ‘Johnny, come on and gamble with me against these \\nbastards. I got the luck. We’ll beat their crullers in.* \\n\\nJohnny sat on a footstool opposite the couch. ‘You know I \\ndon\\'t gamble/ he said. ‘How you feeling, Nino?* \\n\\nNino Valenti grinned at him. ‘Great. I got broads coming \\nup at midnight, then some supper, then back to the blackjack \\ntable. You know 1 got the house beat for almost fifty grand \\nand they’ve been grinding me for a week?\\' \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Johnny Fontane said. ‘Who do you want to leave it \\nto when you croak?’ \\n\\nNino drained his glass empty. ‘Johnny, where the hell did \\nyou get your rep as a swinger? You’re a deadhead, Johnny. \\nChrist, the tourists in this town have more fun than you do.’ \\n\\nJohnny said, ‘ Yeah. You want a lift to that blackjack table?’ \\n\\nNino struggled erect on the sofa and planted his feet firmly \\non the rug. ‘1 can make it,’ he said. He let the glass slip to the \\nfloor and got up and walked quite steadily to where the black- \\njack table had l^en set up. The dealer was ready. The pit boss \\nstood behind the dealer watching. The relief dealer sat on a \\n\\n569 \\n\\n\\n\\nchair away from the table. The cocktail waitress sat on another \\nchair in a line of vision so that she could sec any of Nino \\nValenti’s gestures. \\n\\nNino rapped on the green baize with his knuckles. ‘Chips/ \\nhe said. \\n\\nThe pit boss took a pad from his pocket and filled out a slip \\nand put it in front of NinO with a small fountain pen. ‘ Here \\nyou arc, Mr Valenti,* he said. ‘The usual five thousand to start.* \\nNino scrawled his signature on the bottom of the slip and the \\npit boss put it in his pocket. He nodded to the dealer. \\n\\nThe dealer with incredibly deft fingers took stacks of black \\nand gold one-hundred-doUars chips from the built-in racks \\nbefore him. In not more than five seconds Nino had five even \\nstacks of onc-hundrcd-dollar chips before him, each stack had \\nten chips. \\n\\nThere were six squares a little larget than playing card shapes \\netched in white on the green baize, each square placed to cor- \\nrespond to where a player would sit. Now Nino was placing \\nbets on three of these squares, single chips^ and so playing \\nthree hands each for a hundred dollars. He refused to take a \\nhit on all three hands because the dealer had a six up, a bust \\ncard, and the dealer did bust. Nino raked in his chips and \\nturned to Johnny Fontanc. ‘ That’s how to start the night, huh, \\nJohnny?* \\n\\nJohnny smiled. It was unusual for a gambler like Nino to \\nhave to sign a chit while gambling. A word was usually good \\nenough for the high rollers. Maybe they were afraid Nino \\nwouldn’t remember his take-out because of his drinking. They \\ndidn’t know that Nino remembered everything. \\n\\nNino kept winning and after the third round lifted a finger \\nat t(ie cocktail waitress. She went to the bar at the end of the \\nroom and brought him his usual rye in a water glass. Nino \\ntook the drink, switched it to his other hand so he could put \\nan arm around the waitress. ‘ Sit with me, honey, play a few \\nhands ; bring me luck.’ \\n\\nThe cocktail waitress was a very beautiful girl, but Johnny \\ncould see she was all cold hustle, no real personality, though \\nshe worked at it. She was giving Nino a big smile but her \\ntongue was hanging out for one of those black and gold chips. \\n\\n\\n570 \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat the hell, Johnny thought, why shouldn’t she get some of \\nit? He just regretted that Nino wasn’t getting something better \\nfor his money. \\n\\nNino let the waitress play his hands for a few rounds and \\nthen gave her one of the chips and a pat on the behind to send \\nher away from the table. Johnny motioned to her to bring him \\na drink. She did so but she did it as if she were playing the \\nmost dramatic moment in the most dramatic movie ever made. \\nShe turned all her charm on the great Johnny Fontane. She \\nmade her eyes sparkle with invitation, her walk was the sexiest \\nwalk ever walked, her mouth was very slightly parted as if \\nshe were ready to bite the nearest object of her obvious passion. \\nShe resembled nothing so much as a female animal in heat, but \\nit was a deliberate act. Johnny Fontane thought, oh, Christ, \\none of them. It was the most popular approach of women who \\nwanted to take him to bed. It only worked when he was very \\ndrunk and he wasn’t drunk now. He gave the girl one of his \\nfamous grins and said, ‘Thank you, honey.* The girl looked at \\nhim and parted her lips in a thank-you smile, her eyes went all \\nsmoky, her body tensed with the torso leaning slightly back \\nfrom the long tapering legs in their mesh stockings. An enor- \\nmous tension seemed to be building up in her body, her breasts \\nseemed to grow fuller and swell burstingly against her thin \\nscantily cut blouse. Then her whole body gave a slight quiver \\nthat almost let off a sexual twang. The whole impression was \\none of a woman having an orgasm simply because Johnny \\nFontane had smiled at her and said, ‘ Thank you, honey.’ It was \\nvery well done. It was done better than Johimy had ever seen \\nit done before. But by now he knew it was fake. And the odds \\nwere always good that the broads who did it were a lousy lay. \\n\\nHe watched her go back to her chair and nursed his drink \\nslowly. He didn’t want to see that little trick again. He wasn’t \\nin the mood for it tonight. \\n\\nIt was an hour before Nino Valenti began to go. He started \\nleaning first, wavered back, and then plunged oil the chair \\nstraight to the floor. But the pit boss and the relief dealer had \\nbeen alerted by the first weave and caught him before he hit \\nthe ground. They lifted him and carried him through the parted \\ndrapes that led to the bedroom of the suite. \\n\\n\\n\\nJohnny kept watching as the cocktail waitress helped the \\nother two men undress Nino and shove him under the bed \\ncovers. The pit boss was counting Nino*s chips and making a \\nnote on his pad of chits, then guarding the table with its \\ndealer’s chips. Johnny said to him, ‘How long has that been \\ngoing on?* \\n\\nThe pit boss shrugged. ‘He went early tonight. The first \\ntime we got the house doc and he fixed Mr Valenti up with \\nsomething and gave him some sort of a lecture. Then Nino \\ntold us that we shouldn’t caU the doc when that happened, just \\nput him to bed and he’d be OK in the morning. So that’s what \\nwe do. He’s pretty lucky, he was a winner again tonight, almost \\nthree grand.* \\n\\nJohimy Fontane said, ‘WcD, let’s get the house doc up here \\ntonight, OK? Page the casino floor if you have to.* \\n\\nIt was almost fifteen minutes before Jules Segal came into \\nthe suite. Johnny noted with irritation that this guy never \\nlooked like a doctor. Tonight he was wearing a blue loose- \\nknit polo shirt with white trim, some sort of white suede shoes, \\nand no socks. He looked futmy as hell carrying the traditional \\nblack doctor’s bag. \\n\\nJohnny said, ‘You oughta figure out a way to carry your \\nstuff in a cut -down coif bag.’ \\n\\nJules grinned unaerslanamgly, ‘Yeah, this medical school \\ncarry-all is a real drag. Scares the hell out of people. They \\nshould change the colour anyway.’ \\n\\nHe went over to where Nino was lying in bed. As he opened \\nhis bag he said to\\'Johnny, ‘Thanks for that cheque you sent me \\nas a consultant. It was excessive. 1 didn’t do that much.’ \\n\\n‘Like hell you didn’t,’ Johnny said. ‘Anyway, forget that, \\nthat was a long time ago. What’s with Nino?’ \\n\\nJules was making a quick examination of heartbeat, pulse, \\nand blood pressure. He took a needle out of his bag and shoved \\nit casually into Nino’s arm and pressed the plunger. Nino’s sleep- \\ning face lost its waxy paleness, colour came into the cheeks, \\nas if the blood had started pumping faster. \\n\\n‘Very simple diagnosis,’ Jxiles said briskly. ‘I had a chance \\nto examine him and run some tests when he first came here \\nand fainted. T had him moved to the hospital before he re- \\n\\n\\n57 * \\n\\n\\n\\ngained consciousness. He’s got diabetes, mild adult stabile, \\nwhich is no problem if you take care of it with medication and \\ndiet and so forth. He insists on ignoring it. Also he is firmly \\ndetermined to drink himself to death. His liver is going and his \\nbrain will go. Right now he’s in a mild diabetic coma. My \\nadvice is to have him put away.* \\n\\nJohnny felt a sense of relief. It couldn’t be too serious, all \\nNino had to do was take care df himself. ‘You mean in one of \\nthose joints where they dry you out?* Johnny asked. \\n\\nJules went over to the bar in the far corner of the room and \\nmade himself a drink. ‘No,* he said. ‘I mean committed. You \\nknow, the crazy house.* \\n\\n‘Don’t be funny,* Johnny said. \\n\\n‘ I’m not joking,* Jules said. ‘ I’m not up on all the psychiatric \\njazz but I know something about it, part of my trade. Your \\nfriend Nino can be put back into fairly good shape unless \\nthe liver damage has gone too far, which we can’t know until \\nan autopsy really. But the real disease is in his head. In essence \\nhe doesn’t care if he dies, maybe he even wants to kill himself. \\nUntil that is cured there’s no hope for him. That’s why 1 say, \\nhave him committed and then he can undergo the necessary \\npsychiatric treatment.’ \\n\\nThere was a knock on the door and Johnny went to answer \\nit. It was Lucy Mancini. She came into Johnny’s arms and \\nkissed him. ‘Oh, Johnny, it’s so good to see you,* she said. \\n\\n‘It’s been a long time,’ Johnny Fontane said. He noticed \\nthat Lucy had changed. She had got much slimmer, her \\nclothes were a hell of a lot better and she wore them better. \\nHer hair style fitted her face in a sort of boyish cut. She looked \\nyounger and better than he had ever seen her and the thought \\ncrossed his mind that she could keep him company here in \\nVegas. It woiild be a pleasure hanging out with a real broad. \\nBut before he could turn on the charm he remembered she was \\nthe doc’s girl. So it was out. He made his smile just friendly \\nand said, * What are you doing coming to Nino’s apartment at \\nnight, eh?* \\n\\nShe punched him in the shoulder. ‘1 heard Nino was sick \\nand that Jules came up. I just wanted to see if I could help. \\nNino’s OK, isn’t he?* \\n\\n\\n373 \\n\\n\\n\\n‘Sure/ Johnny said. * He\\'ll be fine.\\' \\n\\nJules Segal had sprawled out on the couch. \\'Like hell he is/ \\nJules said. *I suggest we all sit here and wait for Nino to come \\nto. And then we all talk him into committing himself. Lucy, \\nhe likes you, maybe you can help. Johnny, if you\\'re a real \\nfriend of his you\\'ll go along. Otherwise old Nino\\'s liver will \\nshortly be exhibit A in some university medical lab.’ \\n\\nJohnny was offended by the doctor’s flippant attitude. Who \\nthe heU did he think he was? He started to say so but Nino\\'s \\nvoice came from the bed, ‘ Hey, old buddy, how about a drink ? ’ \\n\\nNino was sitting up in bed. He grinned at Lucy and said, \\n‘ Hey, baby, come to old Nino.\\' He held his arms wide open. \\nLucy sat on the edge of the bed and gave him a hug. Oddly \\nenough Nino didn’t look bad at all now, almost normal. \\n\\nNino snapped his fingers. ‘Come on, Johnny, gimmec a \\ndrink. The night\\'s young yet. Where the hell\\'s my blackjack \\ntable?’ \\n\\nJules took a long slug from his own glass and said to Nino, \\n‘You can\\'t have a drink. Your doctor forbids it.\\' \\n\\nNino scowled. ‘ Screw my doctor.\\' Then a play-acting look \\nof contrition came on his face, ‘Hey, Julie, that’s you. You\\'re \\nmy doctor, right? 1 don\\'t mean you, old buddy. Johnny, get \\nme a drink or I get up out of bed and get it myself.\\' \\n\\nJohnny shrugged and moved towards the bar. Jules said \\nin^fferently, ‘I’m saying he shouldn’t have it.’ \\n\\nJohnny knew why Jules irritated him. The doctor\\'s voice \\nwas always cool, the words never stressed no matter how dire, \\nthe voice always low and controlled. If he gave a warning the \\nwarning was in the words alone, the voice itself was neutral, \\nas if uncaring. It was this that made Johnny sore enough to \\nbring Nino his water glass of whisky. Before he handed it over \\nhe said to Jules, ‘This won’t kill him, right?\\' \\n\\n‘No, it won\\'t kill him,\\' Jules said calmly. Lucy gave him an \\nanxious glance, started to say something, then kept still. Mean- \\nwhile Nino had taken the whisky and poured it down his \\nthroat, \\n\\nJohnny was smiling down at Nino; they had shown the \\npunk doctor.* Suddenly Nino gasped, his face seemed to turn \\nblue, he couldn\\'t catch his breath and was choking for air. \\n\\n\\n374 \\n\\n\\n\\nHis body leaped upwards like a fish, his face was gorged with \\nblood, his eyes bulging. Jules appeared on the other side of \\nthe bed facing Johnny and Lucy. He took Nino by the neck \\nand held him still and plunged the needle into the shoulder \\nnear where it joined the neck. Nino went limp in his hands, \\nthe heaves of his body subsided, and after a moment he \\nslumped down back on to his piUow. His eyes closed in sleep. \\n\\nJohnny, Lucy, and Jules went back into the living room part \\nof the suite and sat around the huge solid coffee table. Lucy \\npicked up one of the aquamarine phones and ordered coffee \\nand some food to be sent up. Johnny had gone over to the bar \\nand mixed himself a drink. \\n\\n‘Did you know he would have that reaction from the \\nwhisky?* Johnny asked. \\n\\nJules shrugged. ‘I was pretty sure he would.’ \\n\\nJohnny said sharply, ‘Then why didn’t you warn me?* \\n\\n‘I warned you,’ Jules said. \\n\\n‘You didn’t warn me right,’ Johnny said with cold anger. \\n‘You arc really one hell of a doctor. You don’t give a shit. \\nYou tell me to get Nino in a cra2y house, you don’t bother \\nto use a nice word like sanatorium. You reaUy like to stick it \\nto people, right?’ \\n\\nLucy was staring down in her lap. Jules kept smiling at \\nFontane, ‘Nothing was going to stop you from giving Nino \\nthat drink. You had to show you didn’t have to accept my \\nwarnings, my orders. Remember when you offered me a job \\nas your personal physician after that throat business? I turned \\nyou down because I knew we could never get along. A doctor \\nthinks he’s God, he’s the high priest in modern society, that’s \\none of his rewards. But you would never treat n!^e that way. \\nI’d be a flunky God to you. Like those doctors you guys have \\nin Hollywood. Where do you get those people from anyway? \\nChrist, don’t they know anything or don’t they just care? They \\nmust know what’s happening to Nino but they just give him \\nall kinds of drugs to keep him going. They wear those sDk \\nsuits and they kiss your ass because you’re a power movie \\nman and so you think they are great doctors. Show bia, docs, \\nyou gotta have heart? Right? But they don’t give a fuck if you \\nlive or die. Well, my little hobby, u^orgivable as it is, is to \\n\\n\\n575 \\n\\n\\n\\nkeep people alive. I let you give Nino that drink to show you \\nwhat could happen to him.* Jules leaned towards Johnny Fon- \\ntane, his voice still calm, unemotional. ‘Your friend is dmost \\nterminal. Do you understand that? He hasn’t got a chance \\nwithout therapy and strict medical care. His blood pressure \\nand diabetes and bad habits can cause a cerebral haemorrhage \\nin this very next instant. His brain will blow itself apart. Is \\nthat vivid enough for you ? Sure, I said crazy house. 1 want you \\nto understand what’s needed. Or you won’t make a move. I’ll \\nput it to you straight. You can save your buddy’s life by having \\nhim committed. Otherwise kiss him goodbye.’ \\n\\nLucy murmured, ‘Jules, darling, Jules, don’t be so tough. \\nJust tell him.’ \\n\\nJules stood up. His usual cool was gone, Johnny Fon- \\ntane noticed with satisfaction. His voice too had lost its quiet \\nunaccented monotone. \\n\\n* Do you think this is the first time I’ve had to talk to people \\nlike you in a situation like this?’ Jules said. ‘I did it every day. \\nLucy says don’t be so tough, but she doesn’t know what she’s \\ntalking about. You know, I used to tell people, “Don’t eat so \\nmuch or you’ll die, don’t smoke so much or you’ll die, don’t \\nwork so much or you’ll die, don’t drink so much or you’ll \\ndie.” Nobody listens. You know why? Because I don’t say, \\n“You will die tomorrow. ” Well, I can tell you that Nino may \\nvery well die tomorrow.’ \\n\\nJules went over to the bar and mixed himself another drink. \\n‘How about it, Johnny, are you going to get Nino com- \\nmitted?’ \\n\\nJohnny said, ‘I don’t know.* \\n\\nJnles took a quick drink at the bar and filled his glass again. \\n‘You know, it’s a funny thing, you can smoke yourself to \\ndeath, drink yourself to death, work yourself to death, and even \\neat yourself to death. But that’s all acceptable. The only thing \\nyou can’t do medically is screw yourself to death and yet that’s \\nwhere they put all the obstacles.* He paused to finish his drink. \\n‘But even that’s trouble, for women anyway. T used to have \\nwomen who weren’t supposed to have any more babies. “It’s \\ndangerous,” I’d tell them. “You could die,” I’d tell them. \\nAnd a month later they pop in, their faces all rosy, and say, \\n\\n576 \\n\\n\\n\\n** Doctor, I think Tm pregnant/’ and sure enough they’d kill \\nthe rabbit. “But it*s dangerous*\\' I’d tell them. My voice used to \\nhave expression in those days. And they\\'d smile at me and \\nsay, “But my husband and I are very strict Catholic,” they\\'d \\nsay.’ \\n\\nThere was a knock on the door and two waiters wheeled in \\na cart covered with food and silver service coffeepots. They \\ntook a portable table from the bottom of the cart and set it up. \\nThen Johnny dismissed them. \\n\\nThey sat at the table and ate the hot sandwiches Lucy had \\nordered and drank the coffee. Johnny leaned back and lit up a \\ncigarette. ‘So you save lives. How come you became an \\nabortionist?’ \\n\\nLucy spoke up for the first time. ‘He wanted to help girls in \\ntrouble, girls who might commit suicide or do something \\ndangerous to get rid of the baby.’ \\n\\nJules smiled at her and sighed. ‘It’s not that simple. I be- \\ncame a surgeon finally. I’ve the good hands, as ballplayers \\nsay. But I was so good I scared myself silly. I’d open up some \\npoor bastard’s belly and know he was going to die. I’d operate \\nand know that the cancer or tumour would come back but I’d \\nsend them off home with a smile and a lot of bullshit. Some \\npoor broad comes in and I slice off one tit. A year later she’s \\nback and 1 slice o£f the other tit. A year after that, I scoop out \\nher insides like you scoop the seeds out of a cantaloupe. After \\nall that she dies anyway. Meanwhile husbands keep calling up \\nand asking, “What do the tests show? What do the tests \\nshow?” \\n\\n‘ So I hired an extra secretary to take all those cal(s. I saw the \\npatient only when she was fully prepared for examination, \\ntests, or operation. I spent the minimum possible time with the \\nvictim because I was, after all, a busy man. And then finally \\nI’d let the husband talk to me for two minutes. “ It’s terminal,” \\nI’d say. And they could never hear that last word. They under- \\nstood what it meant but they never heard it. I thought at first \\nthat unconsciously I was dropping my voice on the last word, \\nso I consciously said it loud^. But still they never heard it. \\nOne guy even said, “What the hell do you mean, it’s ger- \\nminal?” ’ Jules started to laugh. ‘Germinal, terminal, what the \\n\\n\\n577 \\n\\n\\n\\nhell. I started to do abortions. Nice and easy, everybody happy, \\nlike washing the dishes and leaving a clean sink. That was my \\nclass. I loved it, I loved being an abortionist. I don’t believe \\nthat a two-month foetus is a human being so no problems \\nthere. I was helping young girls and married women who were \\nin trouble, I was making good money. I was out of the front \\nlines. When I got caught I felt like a deserter that has been \\nhauled in. But I was lucky, a friend pulled some strings and got \\nme off but now the big hospitals won’t let me operate. So here \\nI am. Giving good advice again which is being ignored just \\nlike in the old days.* \\n\\n‘I’m not ignoring it,’ Johnny Fontane said. ‘I’m thinking it \\nover.’ \\n\\nLucy ffnally changed the subject. ‘What are you doing in \\nVegas, Johnny? Relaxing from your duties as big-time Holly- \\nwood wheel or working?’ \\n\\nJohimy shook his head. ‘Mike Cor leone wants to see me and \\nhave a talk. He’s flying in tonight with Tom Hagen. Tom said \\nthey’U be seeing you, Lucy. You know what it’s aU about?’ \\n\\nLucy shook her head. ‘We’re all having dinner together \\ntomorrow night. Freddie too. I think it might have something \\nto do with the hotel. The casino has been dropping money \\nlately, which shouldn’t be. The Don might want Mike to \\ncheck it out,’ \\n\\n‘I hear Mike flnaUy got his face fixed,’ Johnny said. \\n\\nLucy laughed. ‘ 1 guess Kay talked him into it. He wouldn’t \\ndo it when they were married. I wonder why? It looked so \\nawful and made his nose drip. He should have had it done \\nsooner.’ She paused for a moment. ‘Jules was called in by the \\nC 9 rleone Family for that operation. They used him as a con- \\nsultant and an observer,’ \\n\\nJohnny nodded and said dryly, ‘I recommended him for it. \\n\\n‘ Oh,’ Lucy said. ‘Anyway, ^ke said he wanted to do some- \\nthing for Jules. That’s why he’s having us to dinner tomorrow \\nnight.’ \\n\\nJules said musingly, ‘He didn’t trust anybody. He warned \\nme to keep track of what everybody did. It was foirly straight, \\nordinary surgery. Any competent man could do it.’ \\n\\nThere was a sound from the bedroom of the suite and they \\n\\n578 \\n\\n\\n\\nlooked towards the drapes. Nino had become conscious again. \\nJohnny went and sat on the bed. Jules and Lucy went over to \\nthe foot of the bed. Nino gave them a wan grin. ‘OK, Fll \\nstop being a wise guy. I feel really lousy. Johnny, remember \\nabout a year ago, what happened when we were with those \\ntwo broads down in Palm Springs? I swear to you I wasn’t \\njealous about what happened. 1 was glad. You believe me, \\nJohnny?* \\n\\nJohnny said reassuringly, \\'Sure, Nino, I believe you.* \\n\\nLucy and Jules looked at each other. From everything they \\nhad heard and kr.ew about Johnny Fontane it seemed impos- \\nsible that he would take a girl away from a close friend like \\n^lino. And why was Nino saying he wasn’t jealous a year \\nafter it happened? The same thought crossed both their \\nminds, that Nino was drinking himself to death romanticaUy \\nbecause a girl had left him to go with Johnny Fontane. \\n\\nJules checked Nino again. ‘I’ll get a nurse to be in the room \\nwith you todight,’ Jules said. ‘You reaUy have to stay in bed \\nfor a couple of days. No kidding.* \\n\\nNino smiled. ‘OK, Doc, just don’t make the nurse too \\npretty.’ \\n\\nJules made a call for the nurse and then he and Lucy left. \\nJohnny sat in a chair near the bed to wait for the nurse. Nino \\nwas falling asleep again, an exhausted look on his face. Johnny \\nthought about what he had said, about not being jealous about \\nwhat had happened over a year ago with those two broads \\ndown in Palm Springs. The thought had never entered his \\nhead that Nino might be jealous. \\n\\nA year ago Johnny Fontane had sat in his plush office, the \\noffice of the movie company he headed, and felt as lousy as he \\nhad ever felt in his life. Which was surprising because the first \\nmovie he had produced, widi himself as star and Nino in a \\nfeatured part, was making tons of money. Everything had \\nworked. Everybody had done their job. The picture was \\nbrought in under budget. Everybody was going to make a \\nfortune out of it and Jack Woltz was losing ten years of his \\nlife. Now Johnny had two more pictures in production, one \\nstarring himself, one starring Nino. Nino was great on the \\n\\n\\n579 \\n\\n\\n\\nscreen as one of those channing> dopey lover-boys that \\nwomen loved to shove between their tits. Little boy lost. \\nEverything he touched made money, it was rolling in. The \\nGodfather was getting his. percentage through the bank, and \\nthat made Johnny feel really good. He had justihcd his God- \\nfather’s faith. But today that wasn’t helping much. \\n\\nAnd now that he was a successful independent movie pro- \\nducer he had as much power, maybe more, than he had ever \\nhad as a singer. Beautiful broads feU all over him just like \\nbefore, though for a more commercial reason. He had his own \\nplane, he lived more lavishly even, with the special tax benefits \\na businessman had that artists didn’t get. Then what the hell \\nwas bothering him? \\n\\nHe knew what it was. The front of his head hurt, his nasal \\npassages hurt, his throat itched. The only way he could scratch \\nand relieve that itch was by singing and he was afraid to even \\ntry. He had called Jules Segal about it, when it would be safe \\nto try to sing and Jules had said any time he felt like it. So he’d \\ntried and sounded so hoarse and lousy he’d given up. And his \\nthroat would hurt like hell the next day, hurt in a different \\nway than before the warts had been taken off. Hurt worse, \\nburning. He was afraid to keep singing, afraid that he’d lose \\nhis voice for ever, or ruin it. \\n\\nAnd if he couldn’t sing, what the hell was the use of every- \\nthing else? Ever3rthing else was just bullshit. Singing was the \\nonly thing he really knew. Maybe he knew more about singing \\nand his kind of music than anybody else in the world. He was \\nthat good, he realixed now. All those years had made him a \\nreal pro. Nobody could tell him the right and the wrong, he \\ndidn’t have to ask anybody. He kncw.^What a waste, what a \\ndamn waste. \\n\\nIt was a Friday and he decided to spend the weekend with \\nVirginia and the kids. He called her up as he always did to \\ntell her he was coming. ReaUy to give her a chance to say no. \\nShe never said no. Not in all fhe years they had been divorced. \\nBecause she would never say no to a meeting of her daughters \\nand their father. What a broad, Johnny thought. He’d been \\nlucky with Virginia. And though he knew he cared more about \\nher than any other woman he knew it was impossible for them \\n\\n580 \\n\\n\\n\\nto live together sexually. Maybe when they were sixty-five, like \\nwhen you retire, they’d retire together, retire from everyt^g. \\n\\nBut reality shattered these thoughts when he arrived there \\nand found Virginia was feeling a little grouchy herself and the \\ntwo girls not that crazy to sec him because they had been \\npromised a weekend visit with some girlfriends on a California \\nranch where they could ride horses. \\n\\nHe told Virginia to send the girls off to the ranch and kissed \\nthem goodbye with an amused smile. He understood them so \\nwell. What kid wouldn’t rather go riding horses on a ranch \\nthan hang around with a grouchy father who picked his own \\nspots as a father. He said to Virginia, H’U have a few drinks \\nand then shove off too.’ \\n\\n‘All right,* she said. She was having one of her bad days, rare, \\nbut recognizable. It wasn’t too easy for her leading this kind \\nof life. \\n\\nShe saw him taking an extra large drink. ‘What are you \\ncheering yourself up for?’ Virginia asked. ‘Everything is \\ngoing so beautifully for you. I never dreamed you had it in \\nyou to be such a good businessman.’ \\n\\nJohnny smiled at her. ‘ It’s not so hard,’ he said. At the same \\ntime he was thinking, so that’s what was wrong. He under- \\nstood women and he understood now that Virginia was down \\nbecause she thought he was having everything his own way. \\nWomen really hated seeing their men doing too well. It \\nirritated them. It made them less sure of the hold they exerted \\nover them through affection, sexual custom or marriage ties. \\nSo more to cheer her up than voice his own complaints, \\nJohnny said, ‘What the hell difference does it make if 1 can’t \\nsing.’ \\n\\nVirginia’s voice was annoyed. ‘ Oh, Johnny, you’re not a kid \\nany more. You’re over thirty-five. Why do you keep worrying \\nabout that silly singing stuff? You make more money as a pro- \\nducer anyhow.* \\n\\nJohnny looked at her curiously and said, ‘I’m a singer. 1 \\nlove to sing. What’s being old got to do with that?’ \\n\\nVirginia was impatient. ‘1 never liked your singing anyway. \\nNow that you’ve shown you can make movies, I’m glad you \\ncan’t sing any more.’ \\n\\n\\n\\nThey were both surprised when Johnny said with fury, \\n‘That’s a fucking lousy thing to say.’ He was shaken. How \\ncould Virginia feel like that, how could she dislike him so \\nmuch? \\n\\nVirginia smiled at his being hurt and because it was so \\noutrageous that he should be angry at her she said, ‘How do \\nyou think I felt when all those girls came running after you \\nbecause of the way you sang? How would you feel if I went \\nass-naked down the street to get men running after me? That’s \\nwhat your singing was and I used to wish you’d lose your voice \\nand could never sing again. But that was before we got \\ndivorced.’ \\n\\nJohnny hnished his drink. ‘You don’t understand a thing. \\nNot a damn thing.’ He went into the kitchen and dialled \\nNino’s number. He quickly arranged for them both to go \\ndown to Palm Springs for the weekend and gave Nino the \\nnumber of a girl to call, a real fresh young beauty he’d been \\nmeaning to get around to. ‘She’ll have a friend for you,’ \\nJohnny said. *1*11 be at your place in an hour.’ \\n\\nVirginia gave him a cool goodbye when he left. He didn’t \\ngive a damn, it was one of the few times he was angry with \\nher. The hell with it, he’d just tear loose for the weekend and \\nget all the poison out of his system. \\n\\nSure enough, everything was fine down in Palm Springs. \\nJohnny used his own house down there, it was always kept \\nopen and staffed this time of year. The two girls were young \\nenough to be great fun and not too rapacious for some kind \\nof favour. Some people came over to keep them company at \\nthe pool until suppertime. Nino went to his room with his \\ngirl to get ready for supper and a quick bang while he was still \\nw^rm ftom the sun. Johnny wasn’t in the mood, so he sent \\nhis girl, a short bandbox blonde named Tina, up to shower \\nby herself. He never could make love to another woman after \\nhe’d had a fight with Virginia. \\n\\nHe went into the glass-walled patio living room that held a \\npiano. When singing with the band he had fooled around with \\nthe piano just for laughs, so he could pick out a song in a fake \\nmoonlight-soft ballad style. He sat down now and hummed \\nalong a bit with the piano, very softly, muttering a few words \\n\\n382 \\n\\n\\n\\nbut not really singing. Before he knew it Tina was in the living \\nroom making him a drink and sitting beside him at the piano. \\nHe played a few tunes and she hummed with him. He left her \\nat the piano and went up to take his shower. In the shower he \\nsang short phrases, more like speaking. He got dressed and \\nwent back down. Tina was still alone; Nino was really working \\nhis girl over or getting drunk. \\n\\nJohnny sat down at the piano again while Tina wandered off \\noutside to- watch the pool. He started singing one of his old \\nsongs. There was no burning in his throat. The tones were \\ncoming out muted but with proper body. He looked at the \\npatio. Tina was still out there, the glass door was closed, she \\nwouldn\\'t hear him. For some reason he didn’t want anybody \\nto hear him. He started off fresh on an old ballad that was his \\nfavourite. He sang full out as if he were singing in public, \\nletting himself go, waiting for the familiar burning rasp in his \\nthroat but there was none. He listened to his voice, it .was \\ndifferent somehow, but he liked it. It was darker, it was a \\nman’s voice, not a kid’s, rich he thought, dark rich. He \\nfinished the song easing up and sat there at the piano thinking \\nabout it. \\n\\nBehind him Nino said, ‘Not bad, old buddy, not bad at all.’ \\n\\nJohnny swivelled his body around. Nino was standing in \\nthe doorway, alone. His girl wasn’t with him. Johnny was \\nrelieved. He didn’t mind Nino hearing him. \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Johnny said. ‘Let’s get rid of those two broads. \\nSend them home.’ \\n\\nNino said, ‘You send them home. They’re nice kids. I’m \\nnot gonna hurt their feelings. Besides I just banged mine \\ntwice. How would it look if I sent her away without even \\ngiving her dinner?’ \\n\\nThe hell with it, Johnny thought. Let the girls listen even if \\nhe sounded lousy. He called up a band leader he knew in Palm \\nSprings and asked him to send over a mandolin for Nino. The \\nband leader protested, ‘Hell, nobody plays a mandolin in \\nCalifornia.* Johnny yelled, ‘Just get one.’ \\n\\nThe house was loaded with recording equipment and \\nJohnny had the two girls work the turn-off and volumes. After \\nthey had dinner, Johnny went to work. He had Nino playing \\n\\n383 \\n\\n\\n\\nthe mandolin as accompaniment and sang all his old songs. \\nHe sang them all the way out» not nursing his voice at aU. \\nthroat was fine» he felt that he could sing fot ever. In the \\nmonths he had not been able to sing he had often thought about \\nsinging, planned out how he would phrase lyrics differently \\nnow than as a kid. He had sung the songs in his head with \\nmore sophisticated variations of emphasis. Now he was doing \\nit for red. Sometimes it would go wrong in the actual singing, \\nstuff that had sounded good when he heard it just in his head \\ndidn’t work out when he tried it really singing out loud. \\nOUT LOUD, he thought. He wasn’t listening to himself \\nnow, he was concentrating on performing. He fumbled a little \\non timing but that was OK, just rusty. He had a metronome \\nin his head that would never fail him. Just a little practice was \\nall he needed. \\n\\nFinally he stopped singing. Tina came over to him with eyes \\nshining and gave him a long kiss. ‘ Now I know why Mother \\ngoes to all your movies,’ she said. It was the wrong thing to \\nsay at any time except this. Johnny and Nino laughed. \\n\\nThey played the feedback and now Johnny could reaUy \\nlisten to himself. His voice had changed, changed a hell of a \\nlot but was still unquestionably the voice of Johnny Fontane. \\nIt had become much richer and darker as he had noticed before \\nbut there was also the quality of a man singing rather than a \\nboy. The voice had more true emotion, more character. And \\nthe technical part of his singing was far superior to anything \\nhe had ever done. It was nothing less than masterful. And if \\nhe was that good now, rusty as hell, how good would he be \\nwhen he got in shape again? Johnny grinned at Nino. \\'Is \\nthat as good as 1 think it is?’ \\n\\n\\'Nino looked at his happy face thoughtfully. \\'It’s very damn \\ngood,’ he said. \\'But let’s see how you sing tomorrow.’ \\n\\nJohnny was hurt that Nino should be so downbeat. \\'You \\nson of a bitch, you know you can’t sing like that. Don’t worry \\nabout tomorrow. I feel great.* But he didn’t sing any more that \\nnight. He and Nino took the girls to a party and Tina spent \\nthe night in his bed but he wasn’t much good there. The girl \\nwas a little disappointed. But what the hell, you couldn’t do \\neverything all in one day, Johnny thought. \\n\\n3«4 \\n\\n\\n\\nHe woke up in the morning with a sense of apprehension, \\nwith a vague terror that he had dreamed his voice had come \\nback. Then when he was sure it was not a dream he got scared \\nthat his voice would be shot again. He went to the window and \\nhummed a bit, then he went down to the living room still in \\nhis pyjamas. He picked out a tunc on the piano and after a \\nwhile tried singing with it. He sang mutedly but there was no \\npain, no hoarseness in his throat, so he turned it on. The \\nchords were true and rich, he didn’t have to force it at all. \\nEasy, easy, just pouring out. Johnny realized that the bad time \\nwas over, he had it all now. And it didn’t matter a damn if he \\nfell on his face with movies, it didn’t matter if he couldn’t \\nget it up with Tina the night before, it didn’t matter that Vir- \\nginia would hate him being able to sing again. For a moment \\nhe had just one regret. If only his voice had come back to him \\nwhile trying to sing for his daughters, how lovely that would \\nhave been. That would have been so lovely. \\n\\nThe hotel nurse had come into the room wheeling a cart \\nloaded with medication. Johnny got up and stared down at \\nNino, who was sleeping or maybe dying. He knew Nino \\nwasn’t jealous of his getting his voice back. He understood \\nthat Nino was only jealous because he was so happy about get- \\nting his voice back. That he cared so much about singing. For \\nwhat was very obvious now was that Nino Valenti didn’t care \\nenough about anything to make him want to stay alive. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN ‘ \\n\\n\\nMichael Cor leone arrived late in the evening and, by \\nhis own order, was not met at the airport. Only two men \\naccompanied him: Tom Hagen and a new bodyguard, named \\nAlbert Ncri. \\n\\nThe most lavish suite of rooms in the hotel had been set \\naside for Michael and his party. Already waiting in that suite \\nwere the people it would be necessary for Michael to sec. \\n\\n385 \\n\\n\\nGodfather ] 3 \\n\\n\\n\\nFreddie greeted his brother with a warm embrace. Freddie \\nwas much stouter, more benevolent-looking, ch^fid^ and £ar \\nmore dandified. He wore an exquisitely tailored grey silk suit \\nand accessories to match. His hair was ra2or cut and arranged \\nas carefully as a movie star’s, his face glowed with perfect \\nbarbering, and his hands were manicured. He was an altogether \\ndifferent man than the one who had been shipped out of New \\nYork four years before. \\n\\nHe leaned back and surveyed Michael fondly. ‘You look a \\nhell of a lot better now that you got your face fixed. Your wife \\nfinally talked you into it, huh? How is Kay? When she gonna \\ncome out and visit us out here?’ \\n\\nMichael smiled at his brother. ‘You’re looking pretty good \\ntoo. Kay would have come out this time, but she’s carrying \\nanother kid and she has the baby to look after. Besides this is \\nbusiness, Freddie, I have to fly back tomorrow night or the \\nmorning after.* \\n\\n‘You have to eat something first,’ Freddie said. ‘ We’ve got a \\ngreat chef in the hotel, you’ll get the best food you ever ate. Go \\ntake your shower and change and ever3^thing will be set up right \\nhere. I have all the people you want to see lined up, they’ll be \\nwaiting around for when you’re ready, I just have to call them.’ \\n\\nMichael said pleasantly, ‘Let’s save Moc Greene to the end, \\nOK? Ask Johnny Fontane and Nino up to cat with us. And \\nLucy and her doctor friend. We can tsdk while we cat.’ He \\nturned to Hagen. ‘Anybody you want to add to that, Tom?’ \\n\\nHagen shook his head. Freddie had greeted him much less \\naffectionately than Michael, but Hagen understood. Freddie \\nwas on his father’s shit list and Freddie naturally blamed the \\nC^nsigliori for not straightening things out. Hagen would \\ngladly have done so, but he didn’t know why Freddie was in \\nhis father’s bad graces. The Don did not give voice to specific \\ngrievances. He just made his displeasure felt. \\n\\nIt was after midnight before they gathered around the special \\ndinner table set up in Michael’s suite. Lucy kissed Michad and \\ndidn’t comment on his face looking so much better after the \\noperation. Jules Segal boldly studied the repaired cheekbone \\nand said to Michael, ‘A good job. It’s knitted nicely. Is the \\nsinus OK?’ \\n\\n\\n386 \\n\\n\\n\\n*Fine,’ Midmel said. ‘Thanks for helping out/ \\n\\nDinner focused on Michael as they ate. They all noted his \\nresemblance in speech and manner to the Don. In some \\ncarious way he inspired the same respect, the same awe, and \\nyet he was perfectly natural, at pains to put everyone at their \\nease. Hagen as usual remained in the background. The new \\nman they did not know; Albert Neri was also very quiet and \\nunobtrusive. He had claimed he was not hungry and sat in an \\narmchair close to the door reading a local newspaper. \\n\\nAfter they had had a few drinks and food, the waiters were \\ndismissed. I^chael spoke to Johnny Fontane. ‘ Hear your voice \\nis back as good as ever, you got all your old fans back. Con- \\ngratulations/ \\n\\n‘Thanks,’ Johnny said. He was curious about exactly why \\nMichael wanted to see him. What favour would he be asked? \\n\\nMichael addressed them all in general. ‘ The Corleonc Family \\nis thinking of moving out here to Vegas. Selling out all oui \\ninterests in the olive oil business and settling here. The Don \\nand Hagen and myself have talked it over and we think here \\nis where the future is for the Family. That doesn’t mean right \\nnow or next year. It may take two, three, even four years to \\nget things squared away. But that’s the general plan. Some \\nfriends of ours own a good percentage of this hotel and casino \\nso that will be our foundation. Moe Greene will sell us his \\ninterest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the Family.’ \\n\\nFreddie’s moon face was anxious. ‘Mike, you sure about \\nMoe Greene selling? He never mentioned it to me and he loves \\nthe business. I really don’t think he’ll sell.’ \\n\\nMichael said quietly, ‘I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.\\' \\n\\nThe words were said in an ordinary voice, yet the effect was \\nchilling, perhaps because it was a favourite phrase of the Don’s. \\nMichael turned to Johnny Fontane. ‘The Don is counting on \\nyou to help us get started. It’s been explained to us that enter- \\ntainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers. We hope \\nyou’ll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a \\nweek-long engagement. We hope your friends in movies do \\nthe same. You’ve done them a lot of favours, now you can call \\nthem in.’ \\n\\n‘ Sure,* Johnny said. ‘ I’ll do anything for my Godfather, you \\n\\nJ87 \\n\\n\\n\\nknow that, Mike.’ But there was just the faint shadow of doubt \\nin his voice. \\n\\nMichael soiled and said, ‘You won’t lose money on the deal \\nand neither will your friends. You get points in the hotel, and \\nif there’s somebody else you think important enough, they get \\nsome points too. Maybe you don’t believe me, so let me say \\nI’m speaking the Don’s words.’ \\n\\nJohnny said hurriedly, ‘I believe you, Mike. But there’s ten \\nmore hotels and casinos being built on the Strip right now. \\nWhen you come in, the market may be glutted, you may be \\ntoo late with all that competition already there.’ \\n\\nTom Hagen spoke up. ‘The Corleone Family has friends \\nwho arc financing three of those hotels.’ Johnny understood \\nimmediately that he meant the Corleone Family owned the \\nthree hotels, with their casinos. And that there would be \\nplenty of points to give out. \\n\\n‘I’ll start working on it,’ Johnny said. \\n\\nMichael turned to Lucy and Jules Segal. ‘I owe you,’ he \\nsaid to Jules. ‘1 hear you want to go back to cutting people up \\nand that hospitals won’t let you use their facilities because of \\nthat old abortion business. I have to know from you, is that \\nwhat you want?’ \\n\\nJules smiled. ‘I guess so. But you don’t know the medical \\nset-up. Whatever power you have doesn’t mean anything to \\nthem. I’m afraid you can’t help me in that.’ \\n\\nMichael nodded absentmindedly. ‘Sure, you’re right. But \\nsome friends of mine, pretty well-known people, are going to \\nbuild a big hospital for Las Vegas. The town will need it the \\nway it’s growing and the way it’s projected to grow. Maybe \\nthey’ll let you into the operating room if it’s put to them right. \\nHell, how many surgeons as good as you can they get to come \\nout to this desert? Or any half as good? We’ll be doing the \\nhospital a favour. So stick around. 1 hear you and Lucy are \\ngoing to get married?’ \\n\\nJules shrugged. * When I see that I have any future.’ \\n\\nLucy said wryly, ‘Mike, if you don’t build that hospital. I’ll \\ndie an old maid.’ \\n\\nThey all laughed. All except Jules. He said to Michael, ‘If 1 \\ntook a job like that there couldn’t be any strings attached.’ \\n\\n588 \\n\\n\\n\\nMichael said coldly, *No strings. 1 just owe you and I want \\nto even out.* \\n\\nLucy said gently, ‘Mike, don*t get sore.* \\n\\nMichael smiled at her. ‘I*m not sore.’ He turned to Jules. \\n‘That was a dumb thing for you to say. The Corleonc Family \\nhas pulled some strings for you. Do you think I’m so stupid \\nI’d ask you to do things you’d hate to do? But if I did, so \\nwhat? Who the hell else ever lifted a finger to help you when \\nyou were in trouble? When I heard you wanted to get back \\nto being a real surgeon, I took a lot of time to find out if I \\ncould help. I can. I’m not asking you for anything. But at \\nleast you can consider our relationship friendly, and I assume \\nyou would do for me what you’d do for any good friend. \\nThat’s my string. But you can refuse it.’ \\n\\nTom Hagen lowered his head and smiled. Not even the Don \\nhimself could have done it any better. \\n\\nJules was flushing. ‘Mike, I didn’t mean it that way at \\nall. I’m very grateful to you and your father. Forget I said \\nit.* \\n\\nMichael nodded and said, ‘Fine. Until the hospital gets built \\nand opens up you’ll be medical director for the four hotels. \\nGet yourself a staff. Your money goes up too, but you can \\ndiscuss that with Tom at a later time. And Lucy, I want you \\nto do something more important. Maybe coordinate all the \\nshops that will be opening up in the hotel arcades. On the \\nfinancial side. Or maybe hiring the girls we need to work in \\nthe casinos, something like that. So if Jules doesn’t marry you, \\nyou can be a rich old maid.’ \\n\\nFreddie had been puffing on his cigar angrily. Michael \\nturned to him and said gently, ‘I’m just the errand boy for the \\nDon, Freddie. What he wants you to do he’ll tell you himself, \\nnaturally, but I’m sure it will be something big enough to \\nmake you happy. Everybody tells us what a great job you’ve \\nbeen doing out here.’ \\n\\n‘Then why is he sore at me?* Freddie asked plaintively. \\n‘Just because the casino has been losing money ? I don’t control \\nthat end, Moe Greene does. What the hell does the old man \\nwant from me?’ \\n\\n‘Don’t worry about it,* Michael said. He turned to Johnny \\n\\n389 \\n\\n\\n\\nFontane. * Where\\'s Nino? 1 was looking forward to seeing him \\nagain/ \\n\\nJohnny shrugged. \\' Nino is pretty sick. A nurse is taking care \\nof him in his room. But the doc here says he should be com- \\nmitted, that he’s trying to kill himself. Ninol’ \\n\\nMichael said thoughtfully, really surprised, ^Nino was al- \\nways a real good guy- 1 never knew him to do anything lousy, \\nsay anything to put anybody down. He never gave a damn \\nabout anything. Except the booze.’ \\n\\n* Yeah,’ Johnny said. ‘ llae money is rolling in, he could get a \\nlot of work, singing or in the movies. He gets fifty grand a \\npicture now and he blows it. He doesn’t give a damn about \\nbeing famous. All the years we’ve been buddies I’ve never \\nknown him to do anything creepy. And the son of a bitch is \\ndrinking himself to death.’ \\n\\nJules was about to say something when there was a knock \\non the door of the suite. He was surprised when the man in \\nthe armchair, the man nearest the door, did not answer it but \\nkept reading the newspaper. It was Hagen who went to open \\nit. And was almost brushed aside when Moe Greene came \\nstriding into the room followed by his two bodyguards. \\n\\nMoe Greene was a handsome hood who had made his rep as \\na Murder Incorporated executioner in Brooklyn. He had \\nbranched out into gambling and gone west to seek his fortune, \\nhad been the first person to see the possibilities of Las Vegas \\nand built one of the first hotel casinos on the Strip. He still \\nhad murderous tantrums and was feared by everyone in the \\nhotel, not excluding Freddie, Lucy and Jules Segal. They \\nalways stayed out of his way whenever possible. \\n\\nHis handsome face was grim now. He said to Michael Cor- \\nleone, ‘I’ve been waiting around to talk to you, Mike. I got a \\nlot of things to do tomorrow so 1 figured I’d catch you tonight. \\nHow about it?’ \\n\\nMichael Corleone looked at him with what seemed to be \\nfriendly astonishment. * Sure,’ he said. He motioned in Hagen’s \\ndirection. *Get Mr Greene a drink, Tom.* \\n\\nJules noticed that the man called Albert Neri was studying \\nMoe Greene intently, not paying any attention to the b^y- \\nguards who were leaning against the door. He knew there was \\n\\n\\n590 \\n\\n\\n\\nno chance of any violence, not in Vegas itself. That was \\nstrictly forbidden as fatal to the whole project of making Vegas \\nthe legal sanctuary of American gamblers. \\n\\nMoe Greene said to his bodyguards, ‘Draw some chips for \\nall these people so that they can gamble on the house.* He \\nobviously meant Jules, Lucy, Johnny Fontane, and MichacFs \\nbodyguard, Albert Neri. \\n\\nMichael Corleone nodded agreeably. ‘That’s a good idea.’ \\nIt was only then that Neri got out of his chair and prepared to \\nfollow the others out. \\n\\nAfter the goodbyes were said, there were Freddie, Tom \\nHagen, Moe Greene and Michael Corleone left in the room. \\n\\nGreene put his drink down on the table and said with barely \\ncontrolled fury, ‘What’s this 1 hear the Corleone Family is \\ngoing to buy me out? I’ll hxxj you out. You don’t buy me out.’ \\n\\nMichael said reasonably, ‘Your casino has been losing \\nmoney against all the odds. There’s something wrong with the \\nway you operate. Maybe we can do better.’ \\n\\nGreene kughed harshly. ‘You goddamn Dagos, 1 do you a \\nfavour and take Freddie in when you’re having a bad time and \\nnow you push me out. That’s what you think. 1 don’t get \\npushed out by nobody and I got friends that will back me up.’ \\n\\nMichael was still quietly reasonable. ‘You took Freddie in \\nbecause the Corleone Family gave you a big chunk of money \\nto finish furnishing your hotel. And bankroll your casino. \\nAnd because the Molinari Family on the Coast guaranteed his \\nsafety and gave you some service for taking him in. The Cor- \\nleone Family and you are evened out. I don’t know what you’re \\ngetting sore about. We’ll buy your share at any reasonable \\nprice you name, what’s wrong with that? What’s unfair about \\nthat? With your casino losing money we’re doing you a \\nfavour.’ \\n\\nGreene shook his head. ‘The Corleone Family don’t have \\nthat much muscle any more. The Godfather is sick. You’re \\ngetting chased out of New York by the other Families and you \\nthink you can find easier pickings here. I’ll give you some \\nadvice, Mike, don’t try.’ \\n\\nMichael said softly, ‘Is riiat why you thought you could slap \\nFreddie around in public?’ \\n\\n\\n59 » \\n\\n\\n\\nTom Hagen, startled, turned his attention to Freddie. \\nFreddie Corlcone’s fece was getting red. ‘Ah, Mike, that \\nwasn’t anything. Moe didn’t mean anything. He flies oiT the \\nhandle sometimes, but me and him are good friends. Right, \\nMoe?’ \\n\\nGreene was wary. ‘Yeah, sure. Sometimes I got to kick asses \\nto make this place run right. 1 got sore at Freddie because he \\nwas banging all the cocktail Vaitresses and letting them goof \\noff on the job. We had a little argument and I straightened him \\nout.’ \\n\\nMichael’s face was impassive when he said to his brother, \\n‘You straightened out, Freddie?’ \\n\\nFreddie stared sullenly at his younger brother. He didn’t \\nanswer. Greene laughed and said, ‘The son of a bitch was \\ntaking them to bed two at a time, the old sandwich job. Fred- \\ndie, I gotta admit you really put it to those broads. Nobody \\nelse could make them happy after you got through with them.’ \\n\\nHagen saw that this had caught Michael by surprise. They \\nlooked at each other. This was perhaps the real reason the Don \\nwas displeased with Freddie. The Don was straitlaced about \\nsex. He would consider such cavorting by his son Freddie, two \\ngirls at a time, as degeneracy. Allowing himself to be physically \\nhumiliated by a man like Moe Greene would decrease respect \\nfor the Corleone Family. That too w^ould be part of the reason \\nfor being in his father’s bad books. \\n\\nMichael rising from his chair, said, in a tone of dismissal, ‘I \\nhave to get back to New York tomorrow, so think about your \\nprice.’ \\n\\nGreene said savagely, ‘You son of a bitch, you think you \\ncan just brush me off like that? 1 killed more men than you \\nbefore I could jerk off. I’ll fly to New York and talk to the \\nDon himself. I’ll make him an offer.’ \\n\\nFreddie said nervously to Tom Hagen, ‘Tom, you’re the \\nConsigliori^ you can talk to the Don and advise him.’ \\n\\nIt was then that Michael turned the full chilly blast of his \\npersonality on the two Vegas men. ‘ The Don has sort of semi- \\nretired,’ he said. *I’m running the Family business now. And \\nI’ve moved Tom from the ConsigUori spot. He’ll be strictly \\nmy lawyer here in Vegas. He’ll be moving out with his flunily \\n\\n\\n59 * \\n\\n\\n\\nin a couple of months to get all the legal work started. So any- \\nthing you have to say, say it to me.* \\n\\nNobody answered. Michael said formally, ‘Freddie, you’re \\nmy older brother, I have respect for you. But don’t ever take \\nsides with anybody against the Family again. I won’t even \\nmention it to the Don.* He turned to Moe Greene. ‘Don’t \\ninsult people who are trying to help you. You’d do better to \\nuse your energy to find out why the casino is losing money. \\nThe Corleone Family has big dough invested here and we’re not \\ngetting our money’s worth, but I still didn’t come here to abuse \\nyou. I offer you a helping hand. Well, if you prefer to spit on \\nthat helping hand, that’s your business. I can’t say any more.’ \\n\\nHe had not once raised his voice but his words had a sober- \\ning effect on both Greene and Freddie. Michael stared at both \\nof them, moving away from the table to indicate that he ex- \\npected them both to leave. Hagen went to the door and opened \\nit. Both men left without saying goodnight. \\n\\nThe next morning Michael Q>rlconc got the message from \\nMoe Greene: he would not sell his share of the hotel at any \\nprice. It was Freddie who delivered the message. Michael \\nshrugged and said to his brother, ‘I want to sec Nino before I \\ngo back to New York.’ \\n\\nIn Nino’s suite they found Johimy Fontane sitting on the \\ncouch eating breakfast. Jules was examining Nino behind the \\nclosed drapes of the bedroom. Finally the drapes were drawn \\nback. \\n\\nMichael was shocked at how Nino looked. The man was \\nvisibly disintegrating. The eyes were dazed, the mouth loose, \\nall the muscles of his face slack. Michael sat on his bedside and \\nsaid, ‘Nino, it’s good to catch up with you. The Don always \\nasks about you.’ \\n\\nNino grinned, it was the old grin. ‘Tell him I’m dying. Tell \\nhim show business is more dangerous than the olive oil \\nbusiness.’ \\n\\n‘ You’ll be OK,’ Michael said. ‘If there’s anything bothering \\nyou that the Family can help, just tell me.* \\n\\nNino shook his head. ‘There’s nothing,’ he said. ‘Nothing.’ \\n\\nMichael chatted fot a few more moments and then l<3it. \\n\\n\\n593 \\n\\n\\n\\nFreddie accompanied him and his party to the airport, but at \\nMichael’s request didn’t hang around for departure time. As \\nthey boarded the plane with Tom Hagen and A1 Neri, Michael \\nturned to Neri and said, ‘Did you make him good?’ \\n\\nNeri tapped his forehead. ‘I got Moe Greene mugged and \\nnumbered up here.’ \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT \\n\\n\\nOn the plane ride back to New York, Michael Cotleone re- \\nlaxed and tried to sleep. It was useless. The most terrible period \\nof his life was approachmg, perhaps even a fatal time. It could \\nno longer be put off. Everything was in readiness, all pre- \\ncautions had been taken, two years of precautions. There \\ncould be no further delay. Last week when the Don had for- \\nmally announced his retirement to the capote^mes and other \\nmembers of the Cotleone Family, Michael knew that this was \\nhis father’s way of telling him the time was ripe. \\n\\nIt was almost three years now since he had returned home \\nand over two years since he had married Kay. The three years \\nhad been spent in learning the Family business. He had put \\nin long hours with Tom Hagen, long hours with the Don. \\nHe was amazed at how wealthy and powerful the Cotleone \\nFamily truly was. It owned tremendously valuable real estate \\nin midtown New York, whole office buildings. It owned, \\nthrough fronts, partnerships in two Wall Street brokerage \\nhouses, pieces of banks on Long Island, partnerships in some \\ngarment centre firms, all this in addition to its illegal operations \\nin gambling. . \\n\\nilaic most interesting thing Michael Corleone learned, in \\ngoing back over past transactions of the Corleone Family, was \\nthat the Family had received some protection income shortly \\nafter the war from a group of music record counterfeiters. The \\ncounterfeiters duplicated and sold phonograph records of \\nfiunous artists, packaging everything so skilfully they were \\nnever caught. Naturally on the records they sold to stores the \\n\\n\\n394 \\n\\n\\n\\nartists and original production company received not a penny. \\nMichael Corleone noticed ^t Johnny Fontane had lost a lot \\nof money owing to this counterfeiting because at that time, \\njust before he lost bis voice, his records were the most popular \\nin the country. \\n\\nHe asked Tom Hagen about it. Why did the Don allow the \\ncounterfeiters to cheat his godson? Hagen shrugged. Business \\nwas business. Besides, Johnny was in the Don’s bad graces, \\nJohnny having divorced his childhood sweetheart to marry \\nMargot Ashton. This had displeased the Don greatly. \\n\\n‘How come these\\' guys stopped their operation?’ Michael \\nasked. ‘The cops got on to them?* \\n\\nHagen shook his head. ‘The Don withdrew his protection. \\nThat was right after Connie’s wedding.’ \\n\\nIt was a pattern he was to see often, the Don helping , those \\nin misfortune whose misfortune he had partly created. Not \\nperhaps out of cunning or planning but because of his variety \\nof interests or perhaps because of the nature of the universe, \\nthe interlinking of good and evil, natural of itself. \\n\\nMichael had married Kay up in New England, a quiet \\nwedding, with only her family and a few of her friends present. \\nThen they had moved into one of the houses on the mall in \\nLong Beach. Michael was surprised at how well Kay got along \\nwith his parents and the other people living on the mall. And \\nof course she had got pregnant right away, like a good, old- \\nstyle Italian wife was supposed to, and that helped. The second \\nkid on the way in two years was just icing. \\n\\nKay would be waiting for him at the airport, she always \\ncame to meet him, she was always so glad when he came back \\nftom a trip. And he was too. Except now. For the end of this \\ntrip m«mt that he finally had to take the action he had been \\ngroomed for over the last three years. The Don would be \\nwaiting for him. The capariffmts would be waiting for him. \\nAnd he, Michael Corleone, would have to give ^e orders, \\nmake the decisions whidi would decide hia and his Family’s \\n&te. \\n\\nEvery morning when Kay Adams Corleone got up to take \\ncare of the baby’s early feeding, she saw Mama Corleone, the \\n\\n\\n595 \\n\\n\\n\\nDon’s wife, being driven away from the mall by one of the \\nbodyguards, to return an hour later. Kay soon learned that \\nher mothet -in-law went to church every single morning. \\nOften on her return, the old woman stopped by for morning \\ncoffee and to see her new grandchild. \\n\\nMama Q>rleone always started off by asking Kay why she \\ndidn’t think of becoming a Catholic, ignoring the fact that \\nKay’s child had already been baptised a Protestant. So Kay \\nfelt it was proper to ask the old woman why she went to \\nchurch every morning, whether that was a necessary part of \\nbeing a Catholic. \\n\\nAs if she thought that this might have stopped Kay from \\nconverting the old woman said, ‘Oh, no, no, some Catholics \\nonly go to church on Easter and Christmas. You go when you \\nfeel like going.* \\n\\nKay laughed. ‘Then why do you go every single morning?’ \\n\\nIn a completely natural way. Mama Corleone said, ‘ 1 go for \\nmy husband,* she pointed down towards the floor, ‘so he \\ndon’t go down there.’ She paused. ‘I say prayers for his soul \\nevery day so he go up there.’ She pointed heavenward. She \\nsaid this with an impish smile, as if she were subverting her \\nhusband’s will in some way, or as if it were a losing cause. It \\nwas said jokingly almost, in her grim, Italian, old crone \\nfashion. And as always when her husband was not present, \\nthere was an attitude of disrespect to the great Don. \\n\\n‘How is your husband feeling?* Kay asked politely. \\n\\nMama Corleone shrugged. ‘He’s not the same man since \\nthey shot him. He lets I^chael do all the work, he just plays \\nthe fool with his garden, his peppers, his tomatoes. As if he \\nwdre some peasant still. But men are always like that.’ \\n\\nLater in the morning Connie Corleone would walk across \\nthe mall with her two children to pay Kay a visit and chat. \\nKay liked Connie, her vivaciousness, her obvious fondness for \\nher brother Michael. Connie had taught Kay how to cook some \\nItalian dishes but sometimes brought her own more expert \\nconcoctions over for Michael to taste. \\n\\nNow this morning as she usually did, she asked Kay what \\nMichael thought of her husband. Carlo. Did Michael really \\nlike Carlo, as he seemed to? Carlo had always had a little \\n\\n596 \\n\\n\\n\\ntrouble with the Family but now over the last years he had \\nstraightened out. He was really doing well in the labour union \\nbut he had to work so hard, such long hours. Girlo really \\nliked Michael, Connie always said. But then, everybody liked \\nMichael, just as everybody liked her father. Micha^ was the \\nDon all over again. It was the best thing that Michael was \\ngoing to run the Family olive oil business. \\n\\nKay had observed before that when Connie spoke about her \\nhusband in relation to the Family, she was always nervously \\neager for some word of approval for Carlo. Kay would have \\nbeen stupid if she had not noticed the almost terrified concern \\nConnie had for whether Michael liked Carlo or not. One night \\nshe spoke to Michael about it and mentioned the fact that no- \\nbody ever spoke about Sonny Corleone, nobody even referred \\nto him, at least not in her presence. Kay had once tried to ex- \\npress her condolences to the Don and his wife and had been \\nlistened to with almost rude silence and then ignored. £>he \\nhad tried to get Connie talking about her older brother with- \\nout success. \\n\\nSonny’s wife, Sandra, had taken her children and moved to \\nFlorida, where her own parents nov/ lived. Certain financial \\narrangements had been made so that she and her children could \\nlive comfortably, but Sonny had left no estate. \\n\\nMichael reluctantly explained what had happened the night \\nSonny was killed. That Carlo had beaten his wife and Connie \\nhad called the mall and Sonny had taken the call and rushed \\nout in a blind rage. So naturally Connie and Carlo were always \\nnervous that the rest of the Family blamed her for indirectly \\ncausing Sonny’s death. Or blamed her husband. Carlo. But \\nthis wasn’t the case. The proof was that they had given Connie \\nand Carlo a house in the mall itself and promoted Carlo to an \\nimportant job in the labour union set-up. And Carlo had \\nstraightened out, stopped drinking, stopped whoring, stopped \\ntrying to be a wise guy. The Family was pleased with his work \\nand attitude for the last two years. Nobody blamed him for \\nwhat had happened. \\n\\n‘Then why don’t you invite them over some evening and \\nyou can reassure your sister?’ Kay said. ‘The poor thing is \\nalways so nervous about what you think of her husband. \\n\\n\\n397 \\n\\n\\n\\nTell her. And tell her to put those silly worries out of her \\nhead.* \\n\\ncan*t do that/ Michael said. *We don’t talk about those \\nthings in our family.’ \\n\\n‘Do you want me to tell her what you’ve told me?’ Kay \\nsaid. \\n\\nShe was puzzled because he took such a long time thinking \\nover a suggestion that was obviously the proper thing to do. \\nFinally he said, ‘I don’t think you should, Kay. I don’t think \\nit will do any good. She’ll worry anyway. It’s something no- \\nbody can do anything about.’ \\n\\nKay was amazed. She realized that Michael was always a \\nlittle colder to his sister Connie than he was to anyone else, \\ndespite Connie’s aifection. * Surely you don’t blame Connie for \\nSonny being killed?’ she said. \\n\\nMichael sighed. ‘Of course not,* he said. ‘She’s my kid \\nsister and I’m very fond of her. I feel sorry for her. Carlo \\nstraightened out, but he’s really the wrong kind of husband. \\nIt’s just one of those things. Let’s forget about it.’ \\n\\nIt was not in Kay’s nature to nag; she let it drop. Also she \\nhad learned that Michael was not a man to push, that he could \\nbecome coldly disagreeable. She knew she was the only person \\nin the world who could bend his will, bxit she also knew that \\nto do it too often would be to destroy that power. And living \\n■with him the last two years had made her love him more. \\n\\nShe loved him because he was always fair. An odd thing. \\nBut he always was fair to everybody around him, never arbi- \\ntrary even in little things. She had observed that he was now a \\nvery powerful man, people came to the house to confer with \\nhim and ask favours, treating him with deference and respect \\nbut one thing had endeared him to her above everything dse.. \\n\\nEver since Michael had come back from Sicily with his \\nbroken face, everybody in the Family had tried to get him to \\nundergo corrective surgery. Michael’s mother was after him \\nconstantly; one Sunday dinner with all the Corleones gathered \\non the mall she shouted at Michael, ‘ You look like a gangster \\nin the movies, get your face fixed for the sake of Jesus Christ \\nand your poor wife. And so your nose will stop running like a \\ndrunken Irish.’ \\n\\n\\n598 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Don, at the head of the table, watching everything, said \\nto Kay, *Docs it bother you?* \\n\\nKay shook her head. Tlie Don said to his wife, ‘He’s out of \\nyour bands, it’s no concern of yours.’ The old woman im- \\nmediately held her peace. Not that she feared her husband but \\nbecause it would have been disrespectful to dispute him in \\nsuch a matter before the others. \\n\\nBut Connie, the Don’s favourite, came in from the kitchen \\nwhere she was cooking the Sunday dinner, her face flushed \\nfrom the stove, and said, think he should get his flice fixed. \\nHe was the most handsome one in the family before he got \\nhurt. Come on, Mike, say you’ll do it.’ \\n\\nMichael looked at her in an absentminded fashion. It seemed \\nas if he really and truly had not heard anything said. He didn’t \\nanswer. \\n\\nConnie came to stand beside her father. ‘Make him do it,’ \\nshe said to the Don. Her two hands rested affectionately on his \\nshoulders and she rubbed his neck. She was the only one who \\nwas ever so familiar with the Don. Her affection for her father \\nwas touching. It was trusting, like a little girl’s. The Don \\npatted one of her hands and said, ‘We’re all starving here. Put \\nthe spaghetti on the table and then chatter.’ \\n\\nConnie turned to her husband and said, ‘Carlo, you tell \\nMike to get his face flxed. Maybe he’ll listen to you.’ Her voice \\nimplied that Michael and Carlo Rhezi had some friendly re- \\nlationship over and above anyone else’s. \\n\\nCarlo, handsomely sunburned, blond hair neatly cut and \\ncombed, sipped at his glass of homemade wine and said, ‘No- \\nbody can tell Mike wl^t to do.’ Carlo had become a different \\nman since moving into the mall. He knew his place in the \\nFamily and kept to it. \\n\\nThere was something that Kay didn’t understand in all this, \\nsomething that didn’t quite meet the eye. As a woman she \\ncould see that Connie was deliberately charming her father, \\nthough it was beautifully done and even sincere. Yet it was not \\nspontaneous. Carlo’s reply had been a manly knuckling of his \\nforehead. Michael had absolutely ignored everything. \\n\\nKay didn’t care about her husband’s disfigurement but she \\nworried about his sinus trouble which sprang from it. Surgery \\n\\n\\n599 \\n\\n\\n\\nrepair of the face would cure the sinus also. For that reason she \\nwanted Michael to enter the hospital and get the necessary \\nwork done. But she understood that in a curious way he desired \\nhis disfigurement. She was sure that the Don understood this \\ntoo. \\n\\nBut after Kay gave birth to her first child, she was surprised \\nby Michael asking her, ‘ Do you want me to get my face fixed ? * \\n\\nKay nodded. ‘You know how kids are, your son will feel \\nbad about your face when he gets old enough to understand \\nit’s not normal. I just don’t want our child to see it. 1 don’t \\nmind at all, honestly, Michael.’ \\n\\n‘OK.’ He smiled at her. ‘I’ll do it.’ \\n\\nHe waited until she was home from the hospital and then \\nmade all the necessary arrangements. The operation was suc- \\ncessful. The cheek indentation was now just barely noticeable. \\n\\nEverybody in the Family was delighted, but Connie more so \\nthan anyone. She visited Michael every day in the hospital, \\ndragging Carlo along. When Michael came home, she gave \\nhim a big hug and a kiss and looked at him admiringly and \\nsaid, ‘Now you’re my handsome brother again.’ \\n\\nOnly the Don was unimpressed, shrugging his shoulders \\nand remarking, ‘What’s the difference?’ \\n\\nBut Kay was grateful. She knew that Michael had done it \\nagainst all his own inclinations. Had done it because she had \\nasked him to, and that she was the only person in the world \\nwho could make him act against his own nature. \\n\\nOn the afternoon of Michael’s return from Vegas, Rocco \\nLampone drove the limousine to the mall to pick up Kay so \\nthat she could meet her husband at the airport. She always met \\nher husband when he arrived from out of town, mostly because \\nshe felt lonely without him, living as she did in the fortified \\nmall. \\n\\nShe saw him come off the plane with Tom Hagen and the \\nnew man he had working for him, Albert Neri. Kay didn’t \\ncare much for Neri, he reminded her of Luca Brasi in ^ quiet \\nferociousness. She saw Neri drop behind Michael and ,off to \\nthe side, saw his quick penetrating glance as his eyes swept \\nover everybody nearby. It was Neri who first spotted Kay and \\n\\n\\n400 \\n\\n\\n\\ntouched Michael’s shoulder to make him look in the proper \\ndirection. \\n\\nKay ran into her husband’s arms and he quickly kissed her \\nand let her go. He and Tom Hagen and Kay got into the \\nlimousine and Albert Neri vanished. Kay did not notice that \\nNeri had got into another car with two other men and that thb \\ncar rode behind the limousine until it reached Long Beach. \\n\\nKay never asked Michael how his business had gone. Even \\nsuch polite questions were understood to be awkward, not \\nthat he wouldn’t give her an equally polite answer, but it \\nwould remind them both of the forbidden territory their mar- \\nriage could never include. Kay didn’t mind any more. But \\nwhen Michael told her he would have to spend the evening \\nwith his father Xp tell him about the Vegas trip, she couldn’t \\nhelp making a little frown of disappointment. \\n\\n‘I’m sorry,’ Michael said. ‘Tomorrow night we’ll go into \\nNew York and see a show and have dinner, OK?* He pjitted \\nher stomach, she was almost seven months pregnant. ‘After \\nthe kid comes you’ll be tied down again. Hell, you’re more \\nItalian than Yankee. Two kids in two years.’ \\n\\nKay said tartly, ‘And you’re more Yankee than Italian. Your \\nfirst evening home and you spend it on business.’ But she \\nsmiled at him when she said it. ‘You won’t be home late?’ \\n\\n‘Before midnight,’ Michael said. ‘Don’t wait up for me if \\nyou feel tired.’ \\n\\n‘I’ll wait up,’ Kay said. \\n\\nAt the meeting that night, in the corner room library of Don \\nCorleone’s house, were the Don himself, Michael, Tom Hagen, \\nCarlo Rizzi, and the two caporegimes, Qemenza and Tessio. \\n\\nThe atmosphere of the meeting was by no means so con- \\ngenial as in former days. Ever since Don Corleone had an- \\nnounced his semi-retirement and Michael’s take-over of the \\nFamily business, there had been some strain. Succession in \\ncontrol of such an enterprise as the Family was by no means \\nhereditary. In any other Family powerful caporegimes such as \\nQemenza and Tessio might have succeeded to the position of \\nDon. Or at least they might have been allowed to split off and \\nform their own Family. \\n\\n\\n401 \\n\\n\\n\\nThen, too, ever since Don Q>rleone had made the peace \\nwith the Five Families, the strength of the Corleone Family \\nhad declined. The Baizini Family was now indisputably the \\nmost powerful one in the New York area; allied as they were \\nto the Tattaglias, they now held the position the Corleone \\nFamily had once held. Also they were slyly whittling down the \\npower of the Corleone Family, muscling into their gambling \\nareas, testing the Corleones’ reactions and, finding them weak, \\nestablishing their own bookmakers. \\n\\nThe Barsinis and Tattaglias were delighted with the Don*8 \\nretirement. Michael, formidable as he might prove to be, could \\nnever hope to equal the Don in cunning and infiuence for at \\nleast another decade. The Corleone Family was definitely in a \\ndecline. \\n\\nIt had, of course, suffered serious misfortunes. Freddie had \\nproved to be nothing more than an innkeeper and a ladies’ \\nman, the idiom for ladies’ man untranslatable but connotating \\na greedy infant always at its mother’s nipple - in short, un- \\nmanly. Sonny’s death too, had been a disaster. Sonny had been \\na man to be feared, not to be taken lightly. Of course he had \\nmade a mistake in sending his younger brother, Michael, to \\nkill the Turk and the police captain. Though necessary in a \\ntactical sense, as a long-term strategy it proved to be a serious \\nerror. It had forced the Don, eventually, to rise from his sick- \\nbed, It had deprived Michael of two years of valuable experi- \\nence and training under his father’s tutelage. And of course an \\nIrish as a Consigliort had been the only foolishness the Don had \\never perpetrat^. No Irish man could hope to equal a Sicilian \\nfor cunning. So went the opinion of all the Families and they \\nwere natur^y more respectful to the Barzini-Tattaglia alliance \\nthan to the Corleones. Their opinion of Michael was that be \\nwas not equal to Sonny in force though more intelligent cer- \\ntainly, but not as intelligent as his father. A mediocre successor \\nand a man not to be feared too greatly. \\n\\nAlso, though the Don was generally admired for his states- \\nmanship in making the peace, the fact that he had not avenged \\nSonny’s murder lost the Family a great deal of respect. It was \\nrecognized that such statesmanship sprang out of weakness. \\n\\nAll this was known to the men sitting in the room and \\n\\n\\n402 \\n\\n\\n\\nperhaps even believed by a £ew. Carlo Riazi liked Michael but \\ndid not fear him as he had feared Sonny. Qemenaa, too» \\nthough he gave Michael credit for a bravura performance with \\nthe Turk and the police captain, could not help thinking \\nMichael was too soft to be a Don. Qemenaa had hoped to be \\ngiven permission to form his own Family, to have his own \\nempire split away from the Corleone. But the Don had in- \\ndicated that this was not to be and Qemenza respected the \\nDon too much to disobey. Unless of course the whole situ- \\nation became intolerable. \\n\\nTessio had a better opinion of Michael. He sensed something \\nelse in the young man: a force cleverly kept hidden, a man \\njealously guarding his true strength from public gaze, follow- \\ning the Don’s precept that a friend should always under- \\nestimate your virtues and an enemy overestimate your faults. \\n\\nThe Don himself and Tom Hagen were of course under no \\nillusions about Michael. The Don would never have remed \\nif he had not had absolute faith in his son’s ability to retrieve \\nthe Family position. Hagen had been Michael’s teller for the \\nlast two years and was amazed. at how quickly Michael \\ngrasped all the intricacies of the Family business. Truly his \\nfather’s son. \\n\\nQemenza and Tessio were annoyed with Michael because he \\nhad reduced the strength of their regimes and had never recon- \\nstituted Sonny’s regime. The Corleone Family, in effect, had \\nnow only two fighting divisions with less personnel than \\nformerly. Qemenza and Tessio considered this suicidal, \\nespecially with the Barzini-Tattaglia encroachments on their \\nempires. So now they were hopeful these errors might be \\ncorrected at this extraordinary meeting convened by the \\nDon. \\n\\nMichael started off by telling them about his trip to Vegas \\nand Moc Greene’s refusing the offer to buy him out. ‘But we’U \\nmake him an offer he can’t refuse,’ Michael said. ‘You already \\nknow the Corleone Family plans to move its operations West. \\nWe’ll have four of the hotel casinos on the Strip. But it can’t \\nbe right away. We need time to get things straightened out.’ \\nHe spoke directly to Qemenza. ‘Pete, you and Tessio, I want \\nyou to go along with me for a year without questioning and \\n\\n\\n\\nwithout reservations. At the end of that year, both of you can \\nsplit off from the Corleone Family and be your own bosses, \\nhave your own Families. Of course it goes without saying \\nwe’d maintain our friendship, I wouldn’t insult you and your \\nrespect for my father by thinking otherwise for a minute. But \\nup until that time I want you just to follow my lead and don’t \\nworry. There are negotiations going on that will solve prob- \\nlems that you think are not solvable. So just be a litde patient.’ \\n\\nTessio spoke up. ‘If Moe Greene wanted to talk to your \\nfather, why not let him? The Don could always persuade any- \\nbody, there was never anyone who could stand up to his \\nreasonableness.’ \\n\\nThe Don answered this directly. ‘I’ve retired. Michael would \\nlose respect if I interfered. And besides that’s a man I’d rather \\nnot talk to.’ \\n\\nTessio remembered the stories he’d heard about Moe \\nGreene slapping Freddie Corleone around one night in the \\nVegas hotel. He began to smell a rat. He leaned back. Moe \\nGreene was a dead man, he thought. The Corleone Family did \\nnot msh to persuade him. \\n\\nCarlo Ri22i spoke up. ‘ Is the Corleone Family going to stop \\noperating in New York altogether?’ \\n\\nMichael nodded. ‘We’re selling the olive oil business. Every- \\nthing we can, we turn over to Tessio and Clemenza. But, \\nCarlo, I don’t want you to worry about your job. You grew \\nup in Nevada, you know the state, you know the people. I’m \\ncounting on you being my right-hand man when we make our \\nmove out there.’ \\n\\nCarlo leaned back, his face flushed with gratification. His \\ntimtf was coming, he would move in the constellations of \\npower. \\n\\nMichael went on. ‘Tom Hagen is no longer the Consigliori. \\nHe’s going to be our lawyer in Vegas. In about two months \\nhe’ll move out there permanently with his family. Strictly as a \\nlawyer. Nobody goes to him with any other business as of \\nnow, this minute. He’s a lawyer and that’s all. No reflection \\non Tom. That’s the way I want it. Besides, if I ever need any \\nadvice, who’s a better counsellor than my father?’ They all \\nlaughed. But they had got the message despite the joke. Tom \\n\\n\\n404 \\n\\n\\n\\nHagen was out; he no longet held any power. They all took \\ntheir fleeting glances to check Hagen’s reaction but his face \\nwas impassive. \\n\\nQemenza spoke up in his fat man’s wheeze. ‘Then in a \\nyear’s time we’re on our own, is that it?’ \\n\\n‘Maybe less,* Michael said courteously. ‘Of course you can \\nalways remain part of the Family, that’s your choice. But most \\nof our strength will be out West and maybe you’d do better \\norganized on your own.* \\n\\nTessio said quiedy, ‘In that case I think you should give us \\npermission to recruit new men for our regimes. Those Barzini \\nbastards keep chiselling in on my territory. 1 think maybe it \\nwould be wise to teach them a litde lesson in manners.’ \\n\\nMichael shook his head. ‘No. No good. Just stay still. All \\nthat stuff will be negotiated, everything will be straightened \\nout before we leave.’ \\n\\nTessio was not to be so easily satisfied. He spoke to the .Don \\ndireedy, taking a chance on incurring Michael’s ill will. ‘For- \\ngive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. \\nBut I think you and your son are all wrong with this Nevada \\nbusiness. How can you hope for success there without your \\nstrength here to back you up? The two go hand in hand. And \\nwith you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglia will be too \\nstrong for us. Me and Pete will have trouble, we’ll come under \\ntheir thumb sooner or later. And Barzini is a man not to my \\ntaste. 1 say the Corleone Family has to make its move from \\nstrength, not from weakness. We should build up our regimes \\nand take back our lost territories in Staten Island at least.’ \\n\\nThe Don shook his head. ‘I made the peace, remember, I \\ncan’t go back on my word.’ \\n\\nTessio refused to be silenced. ‘Everybody knows Barzini \\ngave you provocadon since then. And besides, if Michael is the \\nnew chief of the Corleone Family, what’s to stop him from \\ntaking any Action he sees fit? Your v/ord doesn’t strictly bind \\nhim.’ \\n\\nMichael broke in sharply. He said to Tessio, very much the \\nchief now, ‘There are things being negotiated which will \\nanswer your questions and resolve your doubts. If my word \\nisn’t enough for you, ask your Don.’ \\n\\n405 \\n\\n\\n\\nBut Tessio understood he had finally gone too fiu:. If he \\ndared to question the Den he woulc^ make Michael his enemy. \\nSo he shrugged and said, spoke for the good of the Family, \\nnot for myself. I can take care of myself.’ \\n\\nMichael gave him a friendly smile. * Tessio, 1 never doubt \\nyou in any way. I never did. But trust in me. Of course I’m \\nnot equal to you and Pete in these things, but after aU I’ve my \\nfiither to guide me. I won’t do too badly, we’ll aU come out \\nfine.’ \\n\\nThe meeting was over. The big news was that Clememsa and \\nTessio would be permitted to form their own Families from \\ntheir regimes. Tessio would have his gambling and docks in \\nBrooklyn, Qemenaa the gambling in Manhattan and the \\nFamily contacts in the racing tracks of Long Island. \\n\\nThe two caporegimes left not quite satisfied, still a little uneasy. \\nGirlo Riaai lingered hoping that the time had come when he \\nfinally would be treated as one of the family, but he quickly \\nsaw that Michael was not of that mind. He left the Don, Tom \\nHagen, and Michael alone in the corner library room. Albert \\nNeri ushered him out of the house and Carlo noticed that Neri \\nstood in the doorway watching him walk across the floodlit \\nmall. \\n\\nIn the library the three men had relaxed as only people can \\nwho have lived years together in the same house, in the same \\nfunily. Michael served some anisette to the Don and Scotch \\nto Tom Hagen. He took a drink himself, which he rarely did. \\n\\nTom Hagen spoke up first. *Mike, why are you cutting me \\nout of the action?’ \\n\\nMichael seemed surprised. ’You’ll be my number one man \\nin Vegas. We’U be legitimate all the way and you’re the legal \\nman. What can be more important than that?’ \\n\\nHagen smiled a little sadly. ’I’m not talking about that. I’m \\ntalking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime without \\nmy knowledge. I’m talking about you dealing direct with Ned \\nrather than through me or a caporegme. Unless of course you \\ndon’t know what Lampone’s doing.’ \\n\\nMichael said softly, ’How did you find out about Lampone’s \\nregime?* \\n\\nHagen shrugged. ’Don’t worry, there’s no leak, nobody else \\n\\n406 \\n\\n\\n\\nknc»^^\\'5. But in my position 1 can see vrhat’s happening. You \\ngave Lamponc his own living, you gave him a Jot of freedom. \\nSo he needs people to help him in his little empire. But every- \\nbody he recruits has to be reported back to me. And I notice \\neverybody he puts on the payroll is a little too good for that \\nparticular job, is getting a little more money than that parti- \\ncular exercise is worth. You picked the right man when you \\npicked Lampone, by the way. He’s operating perfectly.’ \\n\\nMichael grimaced. ‘Not so damn perfect if you noticed. \\nAnyway the Don picked Lampone.’ \\n\\n‘OK,’ Tom said, ‘so why am I cut out of the action?’ \\n\\nMichael faced him and without flinching gave it to him \\nstraight. ‘Tom, you’re not a wartime ConsigUorL Things may \\nget tough with this move we’re trying to make and we may \\nhave to fight. And I want to get you out of the line of hre too, \\njust in case.’ \\n\\nHagen’s face reddened. If the Don had told him the same \\nthing, he would have accepted it humbly. But where the hell \\ndid Mike come oS making such a snap judgement? \\n\\n*OK,’ he said, ‘but I happen to agree with Tessio. 1 think \\nyou’re going about this all wtong. You’re making the move \\nout of wealmess, not strength. That’s always bad. Barzini is \\nlike a wolf, and if he tears you limb from limb, the other \\nFamilies won’t come rushing to help the Corleones.’ \\n\\nThe Don finally spoke. ‘Tom, it’s not just Michael. 1 ad- \\nvised him on these matters. There are things that may have to \\nbe done that 1 don’t want in any way to be responsible iot. \\nThat is my wish, not Michael’s. I never thought you were a \\nbad Consiglwri. 1 thought Santino a bad Don, may his soul rest \\nin peace. He had a good heart, but he wasn’t the right man to \\nhe^ the Family when 1 had my little misfortune. And who \\nwould have thought that Fredo would become a lackey of \\nwomen? So don’t feel badly. Michael has all my confidence as \\nyou do. For reasons which you can’t know, you must have \\nno part in what may happen. By the way, 1 told Michael that \\nLampone’s secret would not escape your eye. So that \\nshows I have faith m you.* \\n\\nMichael laughed. ‘Ihonestly didn’t think youM pick that up, \\nTom.’ \\n\\n\\n407 \\n\\n\\n\\nHagen knew he was being mollified. * Maybe I can help/ he \\nsaid. \\n\\nMichael shook his head decisively. ‘You’re out, Tom.* \\n\\nTom finished his drink and before he left he gave Michael a \\nmild reproof. ‘You’re nearly as good as your father/ he told \\nMichael. ‘But there’s one thing you still have to learn.’ \\n\\n‘What’s that?* Michael said politely. \\n\\n‘How to say no,’ Hagen answered. \\n\\nMichael nodded gravely. ‘You’re right/ he said. ‘I’U re- \\nmember that.* \\n\\nWhen Hagen had left. Michael said jokingly to his father, \\n‘ So you’ve taught me everything else. Tell me how to say no \\nto people in a way they’ll like.’ \\n\\nThe Don moved to sit behind the big desk. ‘ You cannot say \\n“no” to the people you love, not often. That’s the secret. And \\nthen when you do, it has to sound like a “ yes ”. Or you have \\nto make them say “no”. You have to take time and trouble. \\nBut I’m old-fashioned, you’re the new modern generation, \\ndon’t listen to me.* \\n\\nMichael laughed. ‘Right. You agree about Tom being out, \\nthough, don’t you?’ \\n\\nThe Don nodded. ‘ He can’t be involved in this.* \\n\\nMichael said quietly, ‘I think it’s time for me to tell you that \\nwhat I’m going to do is not purely out of vengeance for Apol- \\nlonia and Sonny. It’s the right thing to do. Tessio and Tom \\nare right about the Barzinis.’ \\n\\nDon Corlcone nodded. ‘Revenge is a dish that tastes best \\nwhen it is cold,’ he said. ‘I would not have made that peace \\nbut that I knew you would never come home alive otherwise. \\nI’m< surprised, though, that Barzini still made a last try at you. \\nMaybe it was arranged before the peace talk and he couldn’t \\nstop it. Are you sure they were not after Don Tommasino?* \\n\\nMichael said, ‘That’s the way it was supposed to look. And \\nit would have been perfect, even you would never have sus- \\npected. Except that I came out alive. I saw Fabrizzio going \\nthrough the gate, running away. And of course I’ve checked \\nit all out since I’ve been back.’ \\n\\n‘Have they found that shepherd?’ the Dori asked. \\n\\n‘I found him,’ Michael said. ‘I found him a year ago. He’s \\n\\n408 \\n\\n\\n\\ngot his own little pma place up in BuH\\'aio. New name, phony \\npassport and identification. He’s doing very well is Fabrizzio \\nthe shepherd.’ \\n\\nThe Don nodded. * So it\\'s to no purpose to wait any longer. \\nWhen will you start?\\' \\n\\nMichael said, ‘ I want to wait until after Kay has the baby. \\nJust in case something goes wrong. And I want Tom settled \\nin Vegas so he won’t be concerned in the affair. I think a year \\nfrom now.* \\n\\n‘You’ve prepared for everything?’ the Don asked. He did \\nnot look at Michael when he said this. \\n\\nMichael said gently, ‘You have no part. You’re not re- \\nsponsible. 1 take all responsibility. T would refuse to let you \\neven veto. If you tried to do that now, I would leave the \\nFamily and go my own way. You’re not responsible.’ \\n\\nThe Don was silent for a long time and then he sighed. He \\nsaid, ‘ So be it. Maybe that’s why I retired, maybe that’s why \\nI’ve turned everything over to you. I’ve done my share in life, \\nI haven’t got the heart any more. And there are some duties the \\nbest of men can’t assume. That’s it then.’ \\n\\nDuring that year Kay Adams Corleone w^s delivered of a \\nsecond child, another boy. She delivered easily, without any \\ntrouble whatsoever, and was welcomed back to the mall like a \\nroyal princess. Connie Corleone presented the baby wnth a silk \\nlayette handmade in Italy, enormously expensive and beautiful. \\nShe told Kay, ‘Carlo found it. He shopped all over New York \\nto get something extra special after I couldn’t find anything I \\nreally liked.’ Kay smiled her thanks, understood immediately \\nthat she was to tell Michael this fine tale. She waa on her way \\nto becoming a Sicilian. \\n\\nAlso during that year, Nino Valenti died of a cerebral \\nhaemorrhage. His death made the front pages of the tabloids \\nbecause the movie Johnny Fontane had featured him in had \\nopened a few weeks before and was a smash hit, establishing \\nNino as a major star. The papers mentioned that Johnny \\nFontane was handling the funeral arrangements, that the \\nfuneral would be private, only funily and dose friends to \\nattend. One sensational story even daimed that in an interview \\nJohnny Fontane had blamed himself for his friend’s death, \\n\\n409 \\n\\n\\n\\nthat he should have forced his friend to place himself under \\nmedical care, but the reporter made it sound like the usual self- \\nreproach of the sensitive but innocent bystander to a tragedy. \\nJohnny Fontane had made his childhood friend, Nino Valenti, \\na movie star and what more could a friend do? \\n\\nNo member of the Corleonc Family attended the California \\nfimeral except Freddie. Lucy and Jules Segal attended. The \\nDon himself had wanted to go to Cdifornia but had suffered a \\nslight heart attack, which kept him in his bed for a month. He \\nsent a huge floral wreath instead. Albert Neri was also sent \\nWest as the official representative of the Family. \\n\\nTwo days after Nino’s funeral, Moe Greene was shot to \\ndeath in the Hollywood home of his movie-star mistress; \\nAlbert Neri did not reappear in New York until almost a month \\nlater. He had taken his vacation in the Caribbean and returned \\nto duty tanned almost black. Michael Corleone welcomed him \\nwith a smile and a few words of praise, which included the \\ninformation that Neri would from then on receive an extra \\nliving’, the Family income from an East Side ‘book’ con- \\nsidered especially rich. Neri was content, satisfied that he lived \\nin a world that pioperly rewarded a man who did his duty. \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE \\n\\nMichael Corleone had taken precautions against every \\neventuality. His planning was faultless, his security impeccable. \\nHe, was patient, hoping to use the full year to prepare. But he \\nwas not to get his necessary year because fate itself took a \\nstand against him, and in the most surprising fashion. For it \\nwas the Godfather, the great Don himself, who failed Michael \\nCorleone. \\n\\nOn one sunny Sunday morning, while the women were at \\nchurch, Don Vito Corleone dressed in his gardening uniform; \\nbaggy grey trousers, a faded blue shirt, battered dirty-brown \\nfedora decorated by a stained grey silk hatband. The Don had \\n\\n\\n410 \\n\\n\\n\\ngained considerable weight in his few years and worked on his \\ntomato vines, he said, for the sake of his health. But he deceived \\nno one. \\n\\nThe truth was, he loved tending his garden ; he loved the sight \\nof it early on a morning. It brought back his childhood in \\nSicily sixty years ago, brought it back without the terror, the \\nsorrow of his own father’s death. Now the beans in their rows \\ngrew little white flowers on top; strong green stalks of scallion \\nfenced everything in. At the foot of the garden a spouted \\nbarrel stood guard. It was filled with liquidy cow manure, the \\nfinest garden fertilizer. Also in that lower part of the garden \\nwere the square wooden frames he had built with his own \\nhands, the sticks cross-tied with thick white string. Over these \\nframes crawled the tomato vines. \\n\\nThe Don hastened to water his garden. It must be done be- \\nfore the sun waxed too hot and turned the water into a prism \\nof fire that could burn his lettuce leaves like paper. Sun was \\nmore important than water, water also was important; but the \\ntwo, imprudently mixed, could cause great misfortune. \\n\\nThe Don moved through his garden hunting for ants. If ants \\nwere present, it meant that lice were in his vegetables and the \\nants were going after the lice and he would have to spray. \\n\\nHe had watered just in time. The sun was becoming hot and \\nthe Don thought, ‘Prudence. Prudence. ’ But there were just a \\nfew more plants to be supported by sticks and he bent down \\nagain. He would go back into the house when he finished this \\nlast row. \\n\\nQuite suddenly it felt as if the sun had come down very close \\nto his head. The air was filled with dancing golden specks. \\nMichael’s oldest boy came running through the garden to- \\nwards where the Don knelt and the boy was enveloped by a \\nyellow shield of blinding light. But the Don was not to be \\ntricked, he was too old a hand. Death hid behind that flaming \\nyellow shield ready to pounce out on him and the Don with a \\nwave of his hand warned the boy away from his presence. Just \\nin time. The sledgehammer blow Inside his chest made him \\nchoke for air. The Don pitched forward into the earth. \\n\\nThe boy raced away to call his father. Michael Corleone and \\nsome men at the maU gate ran to the garden and found the Don \\n\\n\\n\\nlying prone, clutching handfuls of earth. They lifted the Don \\nup and carried him to the shade of his stone-flagged pado. \\nMichael knelt beside his father, holding his hand, while the \\nother men called for an ambulance and doctor. \\n\\nWith a great effort the Don opened his eyes to see his son \\nonce more. The massive heart attack had turned his ruddy \\nface almost blue. He was in extremis. He smelled the garden, \\nthe yellow shield of light smote his eyes, and he whispered, \\n‘ Life is so beautiful. ’ \\n\\nHe was spared the sight of his womcn^s tears, dying before \\nthey came back from church, dying before the ambulance \\narrived, or the doctor. He died surrounded by men, holding \\nthe hand of the son he had most loved. \\n\\nThe funeral was royal. The Five Families sent their Dons \\nand caporegimes^ as did the Tessio and Qemenaa Families. \\nJohnny Fontane made the tabloid headlines by attending the \\nfuneral despite the advice of Michael not to appear. Fontane \\ngave a statement to the newspapers that Vito Corleone was his \\nGodfather and the finest man he had ever known and that he \\nwas honoured to be permitted to pay his last respects to such \\na man and didn’t give a damn who knew it. \\n\\nThe wake was held in the house of the mall, in the old- \\nfashioned style. Amerigo Bonasera had never done finer work, \\nhad discharged all obligations, by preparing his old friend and \\nGodfather as lovingly as a mother prepares a bride for her \\nwedding. Everyone commented on how not even death itself \\nhad been able to erase the nobility and the dignity of the great \\nDon’s countenance and such remarks made Amerigo Bonasera \\nfill with knowing pride, a curious sense of power. Only he \\nknew what a terrible massacre death had perpetrated on the \\nDon’s appearance. \\n\\nAll the old friends and servitors came. Nazorine, his wife, \\nhis daughter and her husband and their children, Lucy Man- \\ncini came with Freddie from Las Vegas. Tom Hagen and his \\nwife and children, the Dons from San Francisco and Los \\nAngeles, Boston and Qeveland. Rocco Lampone and Albert \\nNeri were pallbearers with Qemenza and Tessio and, of course, \\nthe sons of the Don. The mall and all its houses were filled with \\nfloral wreaths. \\n\\n\\n412 \\n\\n\\n\\nOutside the gates of the mall were the newspapermen and \\nphotographers and a small truck that was known to contain \\nFBI men with their movie cameras recording this epic. Some \\nnewspapermen who tried to crash the funeral inside found that \\nthe gate and fence were manned with security guards who \\ndemanded identification and an invitation card. And though \\nthey were treated with the utmost courtesy, refreshments sent \\nout to them, they were not permitted inside. They tried to \\nspeak with some of the people coming out but were met with \\nstony stares and not a syllable. \\n\\nMichael Corleone spent most of the day in the corner library \\nroom with Kay, Tom Hagen, and Freddie. People were ushered \\nin to see him, to offer their condolences. Michael received them \\nwith all courtesy even when some of them addressed him as \\nGodfather, or Don Michael, only Kay noticing his lips tighten \\nwith displeasure. \\n\\nClemenza and Tessio came to join this inner circle and \\nMichael personally served them with a drink. There was some \\ngossip of business. Michael informed them that the mall and \\nall its houses were to be sold to a development and construc- \\ntion company. At an enormous profit, stiU another proof of the \\ngreat Don’s genius. \\n\\nThey all understood that now the whole empire would be in \\nthe West. That the Corleone Family would liquidate its power \\nin New York. Such action had been awaiting the retirement or \\ndeath of the Don. \\n\\nIt was nearly ten years since there had been such a celebra- \\ntion of people in this house, nearly ten years since the wedding \\nof Constanzia Corleone and Carlo Rizzi, so somebody said. \\nMichael walked to the window that looked out on the garden. \\nThat long time ago he had sat in the garden with Kay never \\ndreaming that so curious a destiny was to be his. And his \\nfather dying had said, ‘ Life is so beautiful. ’ Michael could never \\nremember l^s father ever having uttered a word about death, \\nas if the Don respected death too much to philosophize about \\nit. \\n\\nIt was time for the cemetery. It was time to bury the great \\nDon. Michael linked his arm with Kay’s and went out into the \\ngarden to join the host of mourners. Behind him came the \\n\\n\\n413 \\n\\n\\n\\ncaporegjimis followed by their soldiers and then all the humble \\npeople the Godfather had blessed during his lifetime. The \\nbaker Na2orinc, the widow Colombo and her sons and all the \\ncountless others of his world he had ruled so firmly but justly. \\nThere were even some who had been his enemies, come to do \\nhim honour. \\n\\nMichael observed all this with a tight, polite smile. He was \\nnot impressed. Yet, he thought, if I can die saying, Xife is so \\nbeautiful,’ then nothing else is important. If I can believe in \\nmyself that much, nothing else matters. He would follow his \\nfather. He would care for his children, liis family, his world. \\nBut his children would grow in a dilFerent world. They would \\nbe doctors, artists, scientists. Governors. Presidents. Anything \\nat all. He would see to it that they joined the general family of \\nhumanity, but he, as a powerful and prudent parent would \\nmost certainly keep a waty eye on that general family. \\n\\nOn the morning after the funeral, all the most important \\nofficials of the Corleonc Family assembled on the mall. Shortly \\nbefore noon they were admitted into the empty house of the \\nDon* Michael Corleone received them. \\n\\nThey almost filled the corner library room. There were the \\ntwo caporegimes^ Clemcnza and Tessio; Rocco Lampone, with \\nhis reasonable, competent air; Carlo Rizzi, very quiet, very \\nmuch knowing liis place; Tom Hagen, forsaking his strictly \\nlegal role to rally around in this crisis ; Albert Ncri, trying to \\nstay physically dose to Michael, lighting his new Don’s dgar> \\nette, mixing his drink, all to show an unswerving loyalty de- \\nspite the recent disaster to the Corleone Family. \\n\\n\\'J\\'he death of the Don was a great misfortune for the Family. \\nWithout him it seemed that half their strength was gone and \\nalmost all their bargaining power against the Barzini-Tattaglia \\nalliance. Everyone in the room knew this and they waited for \\nwhat Michael would say. In their eyes he was not yet the new \\nDon; he had not earned the position or the title. If the God- \\nfiither had lived, he might have assured his son\\'s succession; \\nnow it was by no means certain. \\n\\nMichael waited until Neri had served drinks. Then he said \\nquietly, ^I just want to tell everybody here that I understand \\n\\n\\n414 \\n\\n\\n\\nhow they feel. I know you all respected my father, but now \\nyou have to worry about yourselves and your families. Some \\nof you wonder how what happened is going to affect the \\nplanning we’ve done and the promises I made. Well, the \\nanswer to that is: nothing. Everything goes on as before.’ \\n\\nQememca shook his great shaggy buffalo head. His hair was \\nan iron grey and his features more deeply embedded in added \\nlayers of fat, were unpleasant. ‘The Barzinis and Tattaglias are \\ngoing to move in on us real hard, Mike. You gotta fight or \\nhave a “sit-down” with them.* Everyone in the room noticed \\nthat Clemenza had not used a formal form of address to \\nMichael, much less the title of Don. \\n\\n‘Let’s wait and see what happens,’ Michael said. ‘Let them \\nbreak the peace first.’ \\n\\nTessio spoke up in his soft voice. ‘They already have Mike. \\nThey opened up two “books ” in Brooklyn this morning. I got \\nthe word from the police captain who runs the protection list \\nat the station house. In a month I won’t have a place to hang \\nmy hat in all Brooklyn.’ \\n\\nMichael stared at him thoughtfully. ‘Have you done any- \\nthing about it?* \\n\\nTessio shook his small, ferretlike head. ‘No,’ he said. ‘I \\ndidn’t want to give you any problems.’ \\n\\n‘Good,’ Michael said. ‘Just sit tight. And I guess that’s what \\nI want to say to aU of you. Just sit tight. Don’t react to any \\nprovocation. Give me a few weeks to straighten things out, \\nto see which way the wind is going to blow. Then I’ll make \\nthe best deal I can for everybody here. Then we’ll have a final \\nmeeting and make some final decisions.’ \\n\\nHe ignored their 8urpri.se and Albert Neri started ushering \\nthem out. Michael said sharply, ‘Tom, stick around a few \\nminutes.’ \\n\\nHagen went to the window that faced the mall. He waited \\nuntil he saw the caporegimes and Carlo Rizzi and Rocco Lam- \\nponc being shepherded through the guarded gate by Neri. \\nThen he turned to Michael and said, ‘Have you got all the \\npolitical connexions wired into you?’ \\n\\nMichael shook his head regretfully. ‘Not aU. I needed about \\nfour more months. The Don and I were working on it. But \\n\\n\\n4*5 \\n\\n\\n\\nTvc got all the judges, we did that first, and some of the more \\nimportant people in Congress. And the big party boys hete in \\nNew York were no problem, of course, llie Corleone Family \\nis a lot stronger than anybody thinks, but I hoped to make it \\nfoolproof.’ He smiled at Hagen. *I guess you’ve figured every- \\nthing out by now.’ \\n\\nHagen nodded. ‘It wasn’t hard. Except why you wanted me \\nout of the action. But I put on my Sicilian hat and 1 finally \\nfigured that too.’ \\n\\nMichael laughed. ‘The old man said you would. But that’s a \\nluxury I can’t afford any more. I need you here. At least for the \\nnext few weeks. You better phone Vegas and talk to your wife. \\nJust tell her a few weeks.’ \\n\\nHagen said musingly, ’‘How do you think they’ll come at \\nyou?’ \\n\\nMichael sighed. ‘The Don instructed me. Through some- \\nbody close. Barzini will set me up through somebody dose \\nthat, supposedly, I won’t suspect.’ \\n\\nHagen smiled at him. ‘ Somebody like me.’ \\n\\nMichael smiled back. ‘You’re Irish, they won’t trust you.’ \\n\\n‘I’m German- American,’ Hagen said. \\n\\n‘To them that’s Irish,* Michael said. ‘They won’t go to you \\nand they won’t go to Neri because Neri was a cop. Plus both \\nof you arc too close to me. They can’t take that gamble. Rocco \\nLamponc isn’t close enough. No, it will be Clemcnza, Tessio, \\nor Carlo Rixzi.’ \\n\\nHagen said softly, ‘I’m betting it’s Carlo.’ \\n\\n‘We’ll sec,’ Michael said. ‘It won’t be long.’ \\n\\nIt was the next morning, while Hagen and Michael were \\nhaving breakfast together. Michael took a phone call in the \\nlibrary, and when he came back to the kitchen, he said to \\nHagen, ‘ It’s all set up. I’m going to meet Barzini a week from \\nnow. To make a new peace now that the Don is dead.’ Michael \\nlaughed. \\n\\nHagen asked, ‘Who phoned you, who made the contact?’ \\nThey both knew that whoever in the Corleone Family had \\nmade the contact had turned traitor. \\n\\nMichael gave Hagen a sad regretful smile. ‘Tessio,’ he said. \\n\\n416 \\n\\n\\n\\nThey ate the test of their breakfast in silence. Over coffee \\nHagen shook his head. could have sworn it would have been \\nCarlo or maybe Oemenza. 1 never £gured Tcssio. He*s the \\nbest of the lot.’ \\n\\n‘He’s the most intelligent,’ Michael said. ‘And he did what \\nseems to him to be the smart thing. He sets me up for the hit \\nby Bartini and inherits the Corlcone Family. He sticks with me \\nand he gets wiped out; he’s figuring I can’t win.’ \\n\\nHagen paused before he asked reluctantly, ‘ How right is he \\nfiguring?’ \\n\\nMichael shrugged. ‘It looks bad. But my father was the only \\none who understood that political connexions and power arc \\nworth ten regimes. I think I’ve got most of my father’s political \\npower in my hands now, but I’m the only one who really knows \\nthat.* He smiled at Hagen, a reassuring smile. ‘I’ll make them \\ncall me Don. But I feel lousy about Tessio.* \\n\\nHagen said, ‘Have you agreed to the meeting with Barzini?’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Michael said. ‘A week from tonight. In Brooklyn, \\non Tessio’s ground where I’ll be safe.’ He laughed again. \\n\\nHagen said, ‘Be careful before then.’ \\n\\nFor the first time Michael was cold with Hagen. * I don’t need \\na Consigliori to give me that kind of advice,’ he said. \\n\\nDuring the week preceding the peace meeting between the \\nCorieone and Barzini Families, Michael showed Hagen just \\nhow careful he could be. He never set foot outside the mall \\nand never received anyone without Neri beside him. There was \\nonly one annoying complication. Connie and Carlo’s oldest \\nboy was to receive his Confirmation in the Catholic Church \\nand Kay asked Michael to be the Godfather. Michael refused. \\n\\n‘I don’t often beg you,’ Kay said. ‘Please do this just for me. \\nConnie wants it so much. And so does Carlo. It’s yery impor- \\ntant to them. Please, Michael.’ \\n\\nShe could see he was angry with her for insisting and ex- \\npected him to refuse. So she was surprised when he nodded and \\nsaid, ‘OK. But I can’t leave the mall. Tell them to arrange for \\nthe priest to confirm the kid here. I’ll pay whatever it costs. If \\nthey run into trouble with the church people, Hagen will \\nstraighten it out.’ \\n\\n\\n417 \\n\\n\\nGodfather— i— ] 4 \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so the day before the meeting with the Barzini Family, \\nMichael Corlcone stood Godfather to the son of Girlo and \\nConnie Rizzi. He presented the boy with an extremely ex- \\npensive wfistwatch and gold band. There was a small party in \\nCarlo’s house, to which were invited the caporegimes^ Hagen, \\nLampune, and everyone who lived on the niall, including, of \\ncourse, the Don’s widow. Connie was so overcome with \\nemotion that she hugged and kissed her brother and Kay all \\nduring the evening. And even Carlo Rizzi became sentimental, \\nwringing Michael’s hand and calling him Godfather at every \\nexcuse ~ old country style. Michael himself had never been so \\naffable, so outgoing. Connie whispered to Kay, ‘I think Carlo \\nand Mike are going to be real friends now. Something like this \\nalways brings people together.’ \\n\\nKay squeezed her sister-in-law’s arm. *l’m so glad,’ she said. \\n\\n\\n418 \\n\\n\\n\\nBook VIII \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY \\n\\nAlbert Neri sat in his Bronx apartment and carefully \\nbrushed the blue serge of his old policeman^s uniform. He \\nunpinned the badge and set it on the table to be polished. The \\nregulation holster and gun were draped over a chair. This \\nold routine of detail made him happy in some strange way, \\none of the few times he had felt happy since his wife had left \\nhim, nearly two years ago. \\n\\nHe had married Rita when she was a high school kid and he \\nwas a rookie policeman. She was shy, dark-haired, from a \\nstraitlaced Italian family who never let her stay out later than \\nten o’clock at night. Neri was completely in love with her, \\nher innocence, her virtue, as well as her dark prettiness. \\n\\nAt first Rita Neri was fascinated by her husband. He was im- \\nmensely strong and she could see people were afraid of him \\nbeotuse of that strength and his unbending attitude towards \\nwhat was right and wrong. He was rarely tactful. If he dis- \\nagreed with a group’s attitude or an individual’s opinion, he \\nkept his mouth shut or brutally spoke his contradiction. He \\nnever gave a polite agreement. He also had a true Sicilian \\ntemper and his rages could be awesome. But he was never \\nangry with his wife. \\n\\nNeri in the space of five years became one of the most feared \\npolicemen on the New York Qty force. Also one of the most \\nhonest. But he had his own ways of enforcing the law. He \\nhated punks and when he saw a bunch of young rowdies \\nmaking a disturbance on a street comer at night, ^sturbing \\npassersby, he took quick and decisive action. He employed a \\nphysical strength that was truly extraordinary, which he him- \\nself did not fully appreciate. \\n\\nOne night in Central Park West he jumped out of the patrol \\ncar and lined up six punks in black silk jackets. His partner \\n\\n\\n419 \\n\\n\\n\\nremained in the driver’s seat, not wanting to get involved, \\nknowing Neri. The six boys, all in their late teens, had been \\nstopping people and asking them for cigarettes in a youth- \\nfully menacing way but not doing anyone any real physical \\nharm. They had also teased girls going by with a sexual gesture \\nmore French than American. \\n\\nNeri lined them up against the stone wall that closed off \\nCentral Park from Eighth Avenue. It was twilight, but Neri \\ncarried his favourite weapon, a huge flashlight. He never \\nbothered drawing his gun; it was never necessary. His face \\nwhen he was angry was so brutally menacing, combined with \\nhis uniform, that the usual punks were cowed. These were no \\nexception. \\n\\nNeri asked the first youth in the black silk jacket, ‘What’s \\nyour name?’ The kid answered with an Irish name. Neri told \\nhim, * Get off the street. I sec you again tonight I’ll crucify you.’ \\nHe motioned with his flashlight and the youth walked quickly \\naway. Neri followed the same procedure with the next two \\nboys. He let them walk off. But the fourth boy gave an Italian \\nname and smiled at Neri as if to claim some sort of kinship. \\nNeri was unmistakably of Italian descent. Neri looked at this \\nyouth for a moment and asked superfluously, ‘You Italian?’ \\nThe boy grinned confidently. \\n\\nNeri hit him a stunning blow on the forehead with his \\nflashlight. The boy dropped to his knees. The skin and flesh \\nof his forehead had cracked open and blood poured down his \\nface. But it was strictly a flesh wound. Neri said to him \\nharshly, ‘You son of a bitch, you’re a disgrace to the Italians. \\nYou give us all a bad name. Get on your feet.’ He gave the \\nyohth a kick in the side, not gently, not too hard. ‘Get home \\nand stay off the street. Don’t ever let me catch you wearing \\nthat jacket again either. I’ll send you to the hospital. Now get \\nhome. You’re lucky I’m not your father.’ \\n\\nNeri didn’t bother with the other two punks. He just booted \\ntheir asses down the Avenue, telling them he didn’t want them \\non the street jthat night. \\n\\nIn such encounters all was done so quickly that there was no \\ntime for a crowd to gather or for someone to protest his \\nactons. Neri would get into the patrol car and his partner \\n\\n4X0 \\n\\n\\n\\nwould zoom it away. Of course once in a while there would \\nbe a real hard case who wanted to fight and might even pull a \\nknife. These were truly unfortunate people. Neri would, with \\nawesome ferocity, beat them bloody and throw them into the \\npatrol car. They would be put under arrest and charged with \\nassaulting an officer. But usually their case would have to wait \\nuntil they were discharged from the hospital. \\n\\nEventually Neri was transferred to the beat that held the \\nUnited Nations building area, mainly because he had not shown \\nhis precinct sergeant the proper respect. The United Nations \\npeople with their diplomatic immunity parked their limousines \\nall over the streets, without regard to police regulations. Neri \\ncomplained to the precinct and was told not to make waves, \\nto just ignore it. But one night there was a whole side street \\nthat was impassable because of the carelessly parked autos. It \\nwas after midnight, so Neri took his huge Rashlight from the \\npatrol car and went down the street smashing windshields to \\nsmithereens. It was not easy, even for high-ranking diplomats, \\nto get the windshields repaired in less than a few days. Pro- \\ntests poured into the police prednet station house demanding \\nprotection against this vandalism. After a week of windshield \\nsmashing the truth gradually hit somebody about what was \\nactually happening and Albert Neri was transferred to Harlem. \\n\\nOne Sunday shortly afterwards, Neri took his wife to visit \\nhis widowed sister in Brooklyn. Albert Neri had the fierce \\nprotective affection for his sister common to all Sicilians and \\nhe always visited her at least once every couple of months to \\nmake sure she was all right. She was much older than he was \\nand had a son who was twenty. This son, Thomas, without a \\nfather’s hand, t^^as giving trouble. He had got into a few minor \\nscrapes, was running a little wild. Neri had once used bis con- \\ntacts on the police force to keep the youth from being charged \\nwith larceny. On that occasion he had kept his anger in check \\nbut had given his nephew warning. ‘Tommy, you make my \\nsister cry over you and I’ll straighten you out myself.’ It was \\nIntended as a friendly pally-uncle warning, not really as a \\nthreat. But even though Tommy was the toughest kid in that \\ntough Brooklyn neighbourhood, he was afraid of his Uncle Al. \\n\\nOn this particular visit Tommy had come in very late \\n\\n\\n421 \\n\\n\\n\\nSaturday night and was still sleeping in his room. His mother \\nwent to wake him, telling him to get dressed so that he could \\neat Sunday dinner with his unde and aunt. The boy’s voice \\ncame harshly through the partly opened door, *1 don’t give a \\nshit, let me sleep,’ and his mother came back out into the \\nkitchen smiling apologetically. \\n\\nSo they had to eat their dWer without him. Neri asked his \\nsister if Tommy was giving her any real trouble and she shook \\nher head. \\n\\nNeri and his wife were about to leave when Tommy finally \\ngot up. He hardy grumbled a hello and went into the kitchen. \\nFinally he yelled in to his mother, *Hey, Ma, how about cook- \\ning me something to eat?* But it was not a request. It was the \\nspoiled complaint of an indulged child. \\n\\nHis mother said shrilly, ’Get up when it’s dinnertime and \\nthen you can cat. I’m not going to cook again for you.’ \\n\\nIt was the sort of little ugly scene that was fairly common- \\nplace, but Tommy still a little irritable from his slumber made \\na mistake. ’Ah, fiick you and your nagging, I’ll go out and \\neat.’ As soon as he said it he regretted it. \\n\\nHis Unde A1 was on him like a cat on a mouse. Not so much \\nfor the insult to his sister this particular day but because it was \\nobvious that he often talked to his mother in such a fiishion \\nwhen they were alone. Tommy never dared say such a thing \\nin front of her brother. This particular Sunday he had just \\nbeen careless. To his misfortune. \\n\\nBefore the frightened eyes of the two women, A1 Neri gave \\nhis nephew a merciless, careful, physical beating. At first the \\nyouth made an attempt at sdf-ddence but soon gave that up \\nand begged for mercy. Neri slapped his face until the lips were \\nswollen and bloody. He rocked the kid’s head back and slam- \\nmed him against the wall. He punched him in the stomach, \\nthen got him prone on the floor and slapped his face into the \\ncarpet. He told the two women to wait and made Tommy go \\ndown the street and get into his car. There he put the fear of \\nGod into him. ’If my sister ever tells me you talk like that to \\nher again, this beating will seem like kisses from a broad,’ he \\ntqld Tommy. ’I want to see you straighten out. Now go up the \\nhouse and teU my wife I’m waiting for her.’ \\n\\n\\n4Z1 \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was two months after this that Ai Neri got back from a \\nlate shift on the force and found his wife had left him. She had \\npacked all her clothes and gone back to her family. Her father \\ntold him that Rita was afraid of him> that she was afraid to live \\nwith him because of his temper. Al was stunned with disbelief. \\nHe had never struck his wife, never threatened her in any way, \\nhad never felt anything but affection for her. But he was so \\nbewildered by her action that he decided to let a few days go \\nby before he went over to her family’s house to talk to her. \\n\\nIt was unfortunate that the next night he ran into trouble on \\nhis shift. His car answered a call in Harlem, a report of a deadly \\nassault. As usual Neri jumped out of the patrol car while it was \\nstill rolling to a stop. It was after midnight and he was carrying \\nhis huge flashlight. It was easy spotting the trouble. There was a \\ncrowd gathered outside a tenement doorway. One Negro woman \\nsaid to Neri, \\'There’s a man in there cutting a little girl.’ \\n\\nNeri went into the hallway. There was an open door at the \\nfar end with light streaming out and he could hear moaning. \\nStill handling the flashlight, he went down the hall and through \\nthe open doorway. \\n\\nHe almost fell over two bodies stretched out on the floor. \\nOne was a Negro woman of about twenty-five. The other was \\na Negro girl of no more than twelve. Both were bloody from \\nrazor cuts on their faces and bodies. In the living room Neri \\nsaw the man who was responsible. He knew him well. \\n\\nThe man was Wax Baines, a notorious pimp, dope pusher, \\nand strong-arm artist. His eyes were popping from drugs now, \\nthe bloody knife he held in his hand wavered. Neri had \\narrested him two weeks before for severely assaulting one of \\nhis whores in the street. Baines had told him, \\'Hey, man, this \\nnone of your business.’ And Neri’s partner had also said some- \\nthing about letting the niggers cut each other up if they wanted \\nto, but Neri had hauled Baines into the station house. Baines \\nwas bailed out the very next day. \\n\\nNeri had never much liked Negroes, and working in Harlem \\nhad made him like them even less. They all were on drugs or \\nbooze while they let their women work or peddle ass. He \\ndidn’t have any use for any of the bastards. So Baines’ brazen \\nbreaking of the bw infuriated him. And the sight of the little \\n\\n\\n\\ngitl all cut up with the tazor sickened him. Quite coolly, in his \\nown mind, he decided not to bring Baines in. \\n\\nBut witnesses were already crowding into the apartment be- \\nhind him, some people who lived in the building and his \\npartner from the patrol car. \\n\\nNeri ordered Baines, ‘ Drop your knife, you’re under arrest.’ \\n\\nBaines laughed. *Man, you gotta use your gun to arrest me.’ \\nHe held his knife up. * Or maybe you want this.’ \\n\\nNeri moved very quickly, so his partner would not have \\ntime to draw a gun. The Negro stabbed with his knife, but \\nNeri’s extraordinary reflexes enabled him to catch the thrust \\nwith his left palm. With his right hand he swung the flashlight \\nin a short vicious arc. The blow caught Baines on the side of \\nthe head and made his knees buckle comically like a drunk’s. \\nThe knife dropped from his hand. He was quite helpless. So \\nNeri’s second blow was inexcusable, as the police depart- \\nmental hearing and his criminal trial later proved with the help \\nof the testimony of witnesses and his fellow policeman. Neri \\nbrought the flashlight down on the top of Baines* skull in an \\nincredibly powerful blow which shattered the glass of the \\nflashlight; the enamel shield and the bulb itself popping out \\nand flying across the room. The heavy aluminium barrel of the \\nflashlight tube bent and only the batteries inside prevented it \\nfrom doubling on itself. One awed onlooker, a Negro man \\nwho lived in the tenement and later testified against Neri, said, \\n*Man, that’s a hard-headed nigger.’ \\n\\nBut Baines’ head was not quite hard enough. The blow caved \\nin his skull. He died two hours later in the Harlem Hospital. \\n\\nAlbert Neri was the only one surprised when he was brought \\nup on departmental charges for using excessive force. He was \\nsuspended and criminal charges were brought against him. \\nHe was indicted for manslaughter, convicted, and sentenced \\nto from one to ten years in prison. By this time he was so filled \\nwith a baffled rage and hatred of all society that he didn’t give \\na damn. That they dared to judge him a criminall That they \\ndared to send him to prison for kifling an animal like that pimp- \\nnigger I That they didn’t give a damn for the woman and litde \\ngirl who had been carved up, disfigured for life, and still in the \\nhospital. \\n\\n\\n4M \\n\\n\\n\\nHe did nor fear prison. He felt that because of his having \\nbeen a policeman and especially because of the nature of his \\noffence, he would be well taken care of. Several of his buddy \\nofHcers had already assured him they would speak to friends. \\nOnly his wife’s father, a shrewd old-style It\\'alian who owned a \\nfish market in the Bronx, realized that a man like Albert Neri \\nhad little chance of surviving a year in prison. One of his \\nfellow inmates might kill him; if not, he was almost certain \\nto kill one of them. Out of guilt that his daughter had deserted \\na fine husband for some womanly foolishness, Neri’s father-in- \\nlaw used his contacts with the Corleone Family (he paid pro- \\ntection money to one of its representatives and supplied the \\nCorleone Family itself with the finest fish available, as a gift), \\nhe petitioned for their intercession. \\n\\nThe Corleone Family knew about Albert Neri. He was \\nsomething of a legend as a legitimately tough cop; he had made \\na certain reputation as a man not •\\'^o be held lightly, as a man \\nwho could inspire fear out of his own person regardless of the \\nuniform and the sanctioned gun he wore. The Corleone Family \\nwas always interested in such men. The fact that he was a \\npoliceman did not mean too much. Many young men started \\ndown a fdse path to their true destiny. Time and fortune \\nusually set them aright. \\n\\nIt was Pete Qemenza, with his fine nose for good personnel, \\nwho brought the Neri afiair to Tom Hagen’s attention. Hagen \\nstudied the copy of the official police dossier and listened to \\nQemenza. He said, * Maybe we have another Luca Brasi here.* \\n\\nQemenza nodded his head vigorously. Though he was very \\nfat, his face had none of the usi^ stout man’s benignity. ‘My \\nthinking exactly. Mike should look into this himself.’ \\n\\nAnd so it was that before Albert Neri was transferred from \\nthe temporary jail to what would have been his permanent \\nresidence upstate, he was informed that the judge had recon- \\nsidered his case on the basis of new information and affidavits \\nsubmitted by high police officials. His sentence was suspended \\nand he was released. \\n\\nAlbert Neri was no fool and his fiither-in-law no shrinking \\nviolet. Neri learned what had happened and paid his debt to \\nthe £athee-m-law by agreeing to get a divorce horn Rita. Then \\n\\n\\n\\nhe made a trip out to Long Beach to thank his benefactor. \\nArrangements had been made beforehand, of course. Michael \\nreceived him in his library. \\n\\nNeri stated his thanks in formal tones and was surprised and \\ngratified by the warmth with which Michael received his \\nthanks. \\n\\n‘Hell, I couldn’t let them do that to a fellow Sicilian,* \\nMichael said. ‘They should have given you a goddamn medal. \\nBut those damn politicians don’t give a shit about anything \\nexcept pressure groups. Listen, I would never have stepped \\ninto the picture if I hadn’t checked everything out and saw \\nwhat a raw deal you got. One of my people talked to your sister \\nand she told us how you were always worried about her and \\nher kid, how you straightened the kid out, kept him from \\ngoing bad. Your father-in-law says you’re the finest feUow in \\nthe world. That’s rare.’ Tactfully Michael did not mention \\nanything about Neri’s wife having left him. \\n\\nThey chatted for a while. Neri had always been a taciturn \\nman, but he found himself opening up to Michael Corleone. \\nMichael was only about five years his senior, but Neri spoke \\nto him as if he were much older, old enough to be his father. \\n\\nFinally Michael said, ‘There’s no sense getting you out of \\njail and ^en just leaving you high and dry. I can arrange some \\nwork for you. I have interests out in Las Vegas, wi^ your \\nexperience you could be a hotel security man. Or if there’s \\nsome little business you’d like to go into, I can put a word in \\nwith the banks to advance you a loan for capital.’ \\n\\nNeri was overcome with grateful embarrassment. He proudly \\nrefused and then added, ‘ 1 have to stay under the jurisdiction \\nof the court anyway with the suspended sentence.’ \\n\\nMichael said briskly, ‘That’s all crap detail, I can fix that. \\nForget about that supervision and just so the banks won’t get \\nchoosy rU have your yellow sheet puDed.’ \\n\\nThe yellow sheet was a police record of criminal ofienccs \\ncommitted by any individual. It was usually submitted to a \\njudge when he was considering what sentence to give a con- \\nvicted criminal. Neri had been long enough on the police \\nforce to know that many hoodlums going up for sentencing \\nhad been treated leniently by the judge because a clean yellow \\n\\n426 \\n\\n\\n\\nsheet had been submitted by the bribed Police Records De- \\npartment. So he was not too surprised that Michael Corleone \\ncould do such a thing; he was, however, surprised that such \\ntrouble would be taken on his account. \\n\\n*If I need help. I\\'ll get in touch,\\' Neri said. \\n\\n*Good, good,\\' Michael said. He looked at his watch and \\nNeri took this for his dismissal. He rose to go. Again he was \\nsurprised. \\n\\n‘Lunchtime,\\' Michael said. ‘Come on and cat with me and \\nmy family. My father said he\\'d like to meet you. We’ll walk \\nover to his house. My mother should have some fried peppers \\nand eggs and sausages. Real Sicilian style.’ \\n\\nThat afternoon was the most agreeable Albert Neri had \\nspent since he was a small boy, since the days before his parents \\nhad died when he was only fifteen. Don Corleone was at his \\nmost amiable and was delighted when he discovered that Neri’s \\nparents had originally come from a small village only a few \\nminutes from his own. The talk was good, the food was \\ndelicious, the wine robustly red, Neri was struck by the thought \\nthat he was finally with his own true people. He understood \\nthat he was only a casual guest but he knew he could find a \\npermanent place and be happy in such a world. \\n\\nMichael and the Don w^ked him out to his car. The Don \\nshook his hand and said, ‘ You\\'re a fine fellow. My son Michael \\nhere, I’ve been teaching him the olive oil business. I’m getting \\nold, I want to retire. And he comes to me and he says he wants \\nto interfere in your little affair. I teU him to just learn about the \\nolive oil. But he won’t leave me alone. He says^ here is this \\nfine fellow, a Sicilian, and they are doing this dirty trick to him. \\nHe kept on, he gave me no peace until I interested myself in \\nit. 1 1^ you this to tell you that he was right. Now that I\\'ve \\nmet you, I’m glad we took the trouble. So if we ran do any- \\nthing further for you, just ask the favour. Understand? We\\'re \\nat your service.\\' (Remembering the Don\\'s kindness, Neri \\nwished the great man was still alive to see the service that \\nwould be done this day.) \\n\\nIt took Neri less than three days to make up his mind. He \\nunderstood he was being courted but understood more. That \\nthe Corleone Family approved that act of his which society \\n\\n\\n4*7 \\n\\n\\n\\ncondemned and had punished him for. The Corleone Family \\nvalued him» society did not. He understood that he would be \\nhappier in the world the Corleoncs had created than in the \\nworld outside. And he understood that the Corleone Family \\nwas the more powerful, within its narrower limits. \\n\\nHe visited Michael again and put his cards on the table. He \\ndid not want to work in Vcga| but he would take a job with \\nthe Family in New York. He made his loyalty clear. Michael \\nwas touched, Neri could see that. It was arranged. But Michael \\ninsisted that Neri take a vacation first, down in Miami at the \\nFamily hotel there, all expenses paid and a month’s salary in \\nadvance so he could have the necessary cash to enjoy himself \\nproperly. \\n\\nThat vacation was Neri’s first taste of luxury. People at the \\nhotel took special care of him, saying, ‘Ah, you’re a friend of \\nMichael Corleone.’ The word had been passed along. He was \\ngiven one of the plush suites, not the grudging small room a \\npoor relation might be fobbed off with. The man running the \\nnightclub in the hotel fixed him up with some beautiful girls. \\nWhen Neri got back to New York he had a slightly different \\nview on life in general. \\n\\nHe was put in the Clemenza regime and tested carefully by \\nthat masterful personnel man. Certain precautions had to be \\ntaken. He had, after all, once been a policeman. But Neri’s \\nnatural ferocity overcame whatever scruples he might have \\nhad at being on the other side of the fence. In less than a year \\nhe had ‘made his bones’. He could never turn back. \\n\\nClemenza sang his praises. Neri was a wonder, the new \\nLuca Brasi. He would be better than Luca, Clemenza bragged. \\nAfter all, Neri was his discovery. Physically the man was a \\nmarvel. His reflexes and coordination such that he could have \\nbeen another Joe DiMaggio. Clemenza also knew that Neri \\nwas not a man to be controlled by someone like himself. Neri \\nwas made directly responsible to Michael Corleone, with Tom \\nHagen as the necessary buffer. He was a ‘special’ and as such \\ncommanded a high salary but did not have his own living, a \\nbookmaking or strong-arm operation. It was obvious that his \\nrespect for Michael Corleone was enormous and one day Hagen \\nsaid jokingly to Michael, ‘Well now you’ve got your Luca.’ \\n\\n428 \\n\\n\\n\\nMichael nodded. He had brought it off. Albert Neri was his \\nman to the death. And of course it was a trick learned from the \\nDon himself. While learning the business, undergoing the \\nlong days of tutelage by his father, Michael had one time asked, \\n‘How come you used a guy like Luca Brasi? An animal like \\nthat?\\' \\n\\nThe Don had proceeded to instruct him. ‘There arc men in \\nthis world/ he said, ‘who go about demanding to be killed. \\nYou must have noticed them. They quarrel in gambling games, \\nthey jump out of their automobiles in a rage if someone so \\nmuch as scratches their fender, they humiliate and bully people \\nwhose capabilities they do not know. I have seen a man, a fool, \\ndeliberately infuriate a group of dangerous men, and he him- \\nself without any resources. These are people who wander \\nthrough the world shouting, “Kill me. Kill me. \" And there is \\nalways somebody ready to oblige them. We read about it in the \\nnewspapers every day. Such people of course do a great deal \\nof harm to others also. \\n\\n‘Luca Brasi was such a man. But he was such an extra- \\nordinary man that for a long time nobody could kill him. Most \\nof these people are of no concern to ourselves but a Brasi is a \\npowerful weapon to be used. The trick is that since he does \\nnot fear death and indeed looks for it, then the trick is to make \\nyourself the only person in the world that he truly desires w/ \\nto loll him. He has only that one fear, not of death, but that \\njou may be the one to kill him. He is yours then.\\' \\n\\nIt was one of the most valuable lessons given by the Don \\nbefore he died, and Michael had used it to make Neri his Luca \\nBrasi. \\n\\nAnd now, finally, Albert Neri, alone in his Bronx apartment, \\nwas going to put on his police uniform again. He brushed it \\ncarefully. Polishing the holster would be next. And his police- \\nman’s cap too, the visor had to be cleaned, the stout black \\nshoes shined. Neri worked with a will. He had found his place \\nin the world, Michael Corleone had placed his absolute trust \\nin him, and today he would not fail that trust. \\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-ONE \\n\\n\\nOn that same day two limousines parked on the ‘Long \\nBeach mall. One of the big cars waited to take Connie Cor- \\nleone, her mother, her husband, and her two children, to the \\nairport. The Carlo Rizzi Family was to take a vacation in Las \\nVegas in preparation for their permanent move to that city. \\nMichael had given Carlo the order, over Connie’s protests. \\nMichael had not bothered to explain that he wanted everyone \\nout of the mall before the Corleone-Barzini Families* meeting. \\nIndeed the meeting itself vras top secret. The only ones who \\nknew about it were the capos of the Family. \\n\\nThe other limousine was for Kay and her children, who were \\nbeing driven up to New Hampshire for a visit with her parents. \\nMichael would have to stay in the mall; he had aii^s too \\npressing to leave. \\n\\nThe night before Michael had also sent word to Carlo Rizzi \\nthat he would require his presence on the mall for a few days, \\nthat he could join his wife and children later that week. Connie \\nhad been furious. She had tried to get Michael on the phone, \\nbut he had gone into the city. Now her eyes were searching the \\nmall for him, but he was closeted with Tom Hagen and not to \\nbe disturbed. Connie kissed Carlo goodbye when he put her in \\nthe limousine. ‘If you don’t come out there in two days, 1*11 \\ncome back to get you,’ she threatened him. \\n\\nHe gave her a polite husbandly smile of sexual complicity. \\n‘I’ll be there,* he said. \\n\\nShe hung out the window. ‘What do you think Michael \\nwants you for?* she asked. Her worried frown made her look \\nold and unattractive. \\n\\nCarlo shrugged. ‘He’s been promising me a big deal. Maybe \\nthat’s what he wants to talk about. That’s what he hinted any- \\nway.’ Carlo did not know of the meeting scheduled with the \\nBarzini Family for that night. \\n\\nConnie said eagerly, ‘Really, Carlo?’ \\n\\n\\n430 \\n\\n\\n\\nCarlo nodded at her reassuringly. The limousine moved off \\nthrough the gates of the mall. \\n\\nIt was only after the first limousine had left that Michael \\nappeared to say goodbye to Kay and his own two children. \\nCarlo also came over and wished Kay a good trip and a good \\nvacation. Finally the second limousine pulled away and went \\nthrough the gate. \\n\\nMichael said, ‘I’m sorry I had to keep you here. Carlo. It \\nwon’t be more than a couple of days.\\' \\n\\nCarlo said qiiickly^ ‘I don\\'t mind at all.* \\n\\n‘Good,* Michael said. ‘Just stay by your phone and I’ll \\nyou when I’m ready for you. I have to get some other dope \\nbefore. OK?’ \\n\\n‘ Sure, Mike, sure,’ Carlo said. He went into his own house, \\nmade a phone call to the mistress he was discreetly keeping in \\nWestbury, promising he would try to get to her late that night. \\nThen he got set with a bottle of rye and waited. He waited a \\nlong time. Cars started coming through the gate shortly aftei \\nnoontime. He saw Clemenza get out of one, and then a little \\nlater Tessio came out of another. Both of them were admitted \\nto Michael\\'s house by one of the bodyguards. Qemenza left \\nafter a few hours, but Tessio did not reappear. \\n\\nCarlo took a breath of fresh air around the mall, not more \\nthen ten minutes. He was familiar with all the guards who \\npulled duty on the mall, was even friendly with some of them. \\nHe thought he might gossip a bit to pass the time. But to \\nhis surprise none of the guards today were men he knew. \\nThey were all strangers to him. Even more surprising, the \\nman in charge at the gate was Rocco Lampone; and Carlo \\nknew that Rocco was of too high a rank in the Family to be \\npulling auch menial duty unless something extraordinary was \\nafoot. \\n\\nRocco gave him a friendly smile and hello. Carlo was wary. \\nRocco said, ‘Hey, I thought you were going on vacation with \\nthe Don?’ \\n\\nCarlo shrugged. ‘MUke wanted me to stick around for a \\ncouple of days. He has something for me to do.’ \\n\\n‘Yeah,’ Rocco Lampone said. ‘Me too. Then he tells me to \\nkeep a check on the gate. Well, what the hell, he’s the boss.’ \\n\\n\\n45 * \\n\\n\\n\\nHis tone implied that Michael was not the man his father was \\na bit derogatory. \\n\\nCarlo ignored the tone, •Mike knows what he’s doing,’ he \\nsaid. Rocco accepted the rebuke in silence. Carlo said so long \\nand walked back to the house. Something was up, but Rocco \\ndidn’t know what it was. \\n\\nMichael stood in the window of his living room and \\nwatched Carlo strolling around the mall. Hagen brought him a \\ndrink, strong brandy. Michael sipped at it gratefully. Behind \\nhim, Hagen said, gently, \\'Mike, you have to start moving. It’s \\ntime.’ \\n\\nMichael sighed. *1 wish it weren’t so soon. I wish the old \\nman had lasted a little longer.’ \\n\\n‘Nothing will go wrong,’ Hagen said. ‘If I didn’t tumble, \\nthen nobody did. You set it up real good.* \\n\\nMichael turned away from the window. ‘The old man plan- \\nned a lot of it. I never realized how smart he was. But I guess \\nyou tenow.’ \\n\\n‘Nobody like him,’ Hagen said. ‘But this is beautiful. This \\nis the best. So you can’t be too bad either.’ \\n\\n‘Let’s see what happens,’ Michael said. ‘Are Tessio and \\nClemenza on che mall?’ \\n\\nHagen nodded. Michael finished the brandy in his glass. \\n\\n‘ Send Qemenza in to me. I’ll instruct him personally. I don’t \\nwant to sec Tessio at all. Just tell him I’ll be ready to go to the \\nBarzini meeting with him in about a half hour. Clemenza’s \\npeople will take care of him after that.’ \\n\\n, Hagen said in a noncommittal voice, ‘There’s no way to let \\nTessio off the hook?’ \\n\\n‘No way,’ Michael said. \\n\\nUpstate in the city of Buffalo, a small pizza parlour on a side \\nstreet was doing a rush trade. As the lunch hours passed, busi- \\nness finally slackened off and the counterman took his round \\ntin tray with its few leftover slices out of the window and put \\nit on the shelf of the huge brick oven. He peeked into the oven \\nat a pie baking there. The cheese had not yet started to bubble. \\nWhen he turned back to the counter that enabled him to serve \\n\\n\\n45 ^ \\n\\n\\n\\npeople in the street, there was a young, tough-looking man \\nstanding there. The man said, \\'Gimme a slice/ \\n\\nThe pi 22 a counterman took his wooden shovel and scooped \\none of the cold slices into the oven to warm it up. The cus- \\ntomer, instead of waiting outside, decided to come through \\nthe door and be served. The store was empty now. The \\ncounterman opened the oven and took out the hot slice and \\nserved it on a paper plate. But the customer, instead of giving \\nthe money for it, was staring at him intently. \\n\\n\\'I hear you got a great tattoo on your chest,’ the customer \\nsaid. \\'1 can set the top of it over your shirt, how about letting \\nme see the rest of it?’ \\n\\nThe counterman froze. He seemed to be paralysed. \\n\\n‘Open your shirt,’ the customer said. \\n\\nThe counterman shook his head. ‘1 got no tattoo,* he said in \\nheavily accented English. ‘ That’s the man who works at night.* \\n\\nThe customer laughed. It was an unpleasant laugh, harsh, \\nstrained. ‘Come on, unbutton your shirt, let me see.’ \\n\\nThe counterman started backing towards the rear of the \\nstore, aiming to edge around the huge oven. But the customer \\nraised his hand above the counter. There was a gun in it. He \\nfired. The bxiUet caught the counterman in the chest and \\nhurled him against the oven. Hie customer fired into his body \\nagain and the counterman slumped to the floor. The customer \\ncame around the serving shelf, reached down and tipped the \\nbuttons off the shirt. The chest was covered with blood, but \\nthe tattoo was visible, the intertwined lovers and the knife \\ntransfixing them. The counterman raised one of his arms feebly \\nas if to protect himself. The gunman said, ‘Fabr^io, Michad \\nCorleone sends you his regards.’ He extended the gun so that \\nit was only a few inches from the counterman’s skull and pulled \\nthe trigger. Then he walked out of the store. At the kerb a car \\nwas waiting for him with its door open. He jumped in and the \\ncar sped off. \\n\\nRocco Lampone answered the phone installed on one of the \\niron pillars of the gate. He heard someone saying, ‘Your pack- \\nage is ready,’ and the click as the caller hung up. Rocco got \\ninto his car and drove out of the mall. He crossed the Jones \\n\\n\\n45J \\n\\n\\n\\nBeach Causeway, the same causeway on which Sonny Corleone \\nhad been killed, and drove out to the railroad station of Wan- \\ntagh. He parked his car there. Another car was waiting for \\nhim with two men in it. They drove to a motel ten minutes \\nfurther out on Sunrise Highway and turned into its courtyard, \\nRocco Lampone, leaving his two men in the car, went to one \\nof the little chalet-type bungalows. One kick sent its door flying \\noff its hinges and Rocco sprang into the room. \\n\\nPhillip Tattaglia, seventy years old and naked as a baby, \\nstood over a bed on which lay a young girl. Phillip Tattaglia\\'s \\nthick head of hair was jet black, but the plumage of his crotch \\nwas steel grey. His body had the soft plumpness of a bird. \\nRocco pumped four bullets into him, all in the belly. Then he \\nturned and ran back to the car. The two men dropped him off \\nin the Wantagh station. He picked up his car and drove back \\nto the mall. He went in to see Michael Corleone for a moment \\nand then came out and took up his position at the gate. \\n\\nAlbert Neri, alone in his apartment, flnished getting his \\nuniform ready. Slowly he put it on, trousers, shirt, tie, and \\njacket, holster, and gunbelt. He had turned in his gun when he \\nwas suspended from the force, but, through some adminis- \\ntrative oversight they had not made him give up his shield. \\nClemenza had supplied him with a new .38 Police Special that \\ncould not be traced. Neri broke it down, oiled it, checked the \\nhammer, put it together again, clicked the trigger. He loaded \\nthe cylinders and was set to go. \\n\\nHe put the policeman’s cap in a heavy paper bag and then \\nput a civilian overcoat on to cover his uniform. He checked \\nhis watch. Fifteen minutes before the car would be waiting \\nfor him downstairs. He spent the fifteen minutes checking \\nhimself in the mirror. There was no question. He looked like \\na real cop. \\n\\nThe carwfji^s waiting with two of Rocco Lampone’s men in \\nfront. Neri got into the back seat. As the car started downtown, \\nafter they had left the neighbourhood of his apartment, he \\nshrugged off the civilian overcoat and left it on the floor of the \\ncar. He ript^ed open the paper bag and put the police officer’s \\ncap on his head. \\n\\n\\n454 \\n\\n\\n\\nAt 55th Street and Fifth Avenue the car pulled over to the \\nkerb and Neri got out. He started walking down the avenue. \\nHe had a queer feeling being back in uniform, patrolling the \\nstreets as he had done so many times. There were crowds of \\npeople. He walked downtown until he was in front of Rocke- \\nfeller Centre, across the way from St Patrick’s Cathedral. On \\nhis side of Fifth Avenue he spotted the limousine he was look- \\ning for. It was parked, nakedly alone between a whole string \\nof red NO PARKING and no standing signs. Neri slowed \\nhis pace. He was too early. He stopped to write something in \\nhis summons book and then kept walking. He was abreast of \\nthe limousine. He tapped its fender with his nightstick. The \\ndriver looked up in surprise. Neri pointed to the no stand- \\ning sign with his stick and motioned the driver to move his \\ncar. The driver turned his head away. \\n\\nNeri walked out into the street so that he was standing by \\nthe driver’s open window. The driver was a tough-looking \\nhood, just the kind he loved to break up. Neri said with \\ndeliberate insultingness, ‘OK, wise guy, you want me to stick \\na summons up your ass or do you wanta get moving?’ \\n\\nThe driver said impassively, ‘You better check with your \\nprecinct. Just give me the ticket if it’ll make you feel happy.* \\n\\n‘Get the hell out of here,’ Neri said, ‘or I’ll drag you out of \\nthat car and break your ass.’ \\n\\nThe driver made a ten-doliar bill appear by some sort of \\nmagic, folded it into a little square using just one band, and \\ntried to shove it inside Ned’s blouse. Neri moved back on to \\nthe sidewalk and crooked his finger at the driver. The ddver \\ncame out of the car. \\n\\n‘Let me see your licence and registration,’ Neri said. He had \\nbeen hoping to get the driver to go around the block but there \\nwas no hope for that now. Out of the corner of his eye, Neri \\nsaw three short, heavyset men coming down the steps of the \\nPlaaa building, coming down towards the street. It was Barzini \\nhimself and his two bodyguards, on their way to meet hiichael \\nCorleone. Even as he saw this, one of the bodyguards peeled \\noff to come ahead and see what was wrong with Barzini’s \\ncar. \\n\\nThis man asked the driver, ‘What’s up?’ \\n\\n\\n435 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe driver said curdy, ^Tm getting a ticket, no sweat. This \\nguy must be new in the precinct.* \\n\\nAt that moment Barrini came up with his other bodyguard. \\nFc growled, ‘What the hell is wrong now?* \\n\\nNeri finished writing in his summons book and gave the \\ndriver back his registration and licence. Then he put his sum* \\nmons book back in his hip pocket and with the forward \\nmotion of his hand drew the .58 Special. \\n\\nHe put three bullets in Barzini’s bwirrel chest before the other \\nthree men unfroze enough to dive for cover. By that time Neri \\nhad darted into the crowd and around the corner where the car \\nwas waiting for him. The car sped up to Ninth Avenue and \\nturned downtown. Near Chelsea Park, Neri, who had dis- \\ncarded the cap and put on the overcoat and changed clothing, \\ntransferred to another car th«t was waiting for him. He had \\nleft the gun and the police uniform in the other car. It would \\nbe got rid of. An hour later he was safely in the mall on \\nLong Beach and talking to Michael Corleone. \\n\\nTessio was waiting in the kitchen of the old Don*s house \\nand was sipping at a cup of codec when Tom Hagen came \\nfor him. ‘Mike is ready for you now,* Hagen said. ‘You \\nbetter make your call to Barzini and tell him to start on his \\nway.* \\n\\nTessio rose and went to the wall phone. He dialled Barzini’s \\noffice in New York and said curtly, ‘Wc*rc on our way to \\nBrooklyn.’ He hung up and smiled at Hagen. ‘1 hope Mike can \\nget us a good deal tonight.* \\n\\nHagen said gravely, ‘I*m sure he will.’ He escorted Tessio \\nout of the kitchen and on to the mall. They walked towards \\nMichael’s house. At the door they were stopped by one of the \\nbodyguards. ‘The boss says he’ll come in a separate car. He \\nsays for you two to go on ahead.’ \\n\\nTessio frowned and turned to Hagen. ‘Hell, he can’t do \\nthat; that screws up all my arrangements.* \\n\\nAt that moment ^ree more bodyguards materialized around \\nthem. Hagen said gendy, ‘1 can’t go with you either, Tessio.’ \\n\\nThe ferret-faced caporegime imderstood everything in a flash \\nof a second. And accepted it. There was a moment of physical \\n\\n456 \\n\\n\\n\\nweakness^ and then he recovefcd. He said to Hagen, *Tell \\nMike it was business, 1 always liked him/ \\n\\nHagen nodded. *He understands that/ \\n\\nTessio paused for a moment and then said softJy, ‘Tom, can \\nyou get me off the hook? For old times’ sake?’ \\n\\nHagen shook his head. ‘1 can’t,’ he said. \\n\\nHe watched Tessio being surrounded by bodyguards and \\nled into a waiting car. He felt a little sick. Tessio had been the \\nbest soldier in the Corleone Family; the old Don had relied \\non him more than any other man with the exception of Luca \\nBrasi. It was too bad that so intelligent a man had made such a \\nfatal error in judgement so late in life. \\n\\nGurlo Rizxi, still waiting for his interview with Michael, be- \\ncame jittery with all the arrivals and departures. Obviously \\nsomething big was going on and it looked as if he were going \\nto be left out. Impatiently he called Michael on the phone. One \\nof the house bodyguards answered, went to get Michael, and \\ncame back with the message that Michael wanted him to sit \\ntight, that he would get to him soon. \\n\\nGu:lo called up his mistress again and told her he was sure \\nhe would be able to take her to a late supper and spend the \\nnight. Michael had said he would caU him soon, whatever he \\nhad planned couldn’t take more than an hour or two. Then it \\nwould take him about forty minutes to drive to Westbury. It \\ncould be done. He promised her he would do it and sweet- \\ntalked her into not being sore. When he bung up he decided \\nto get properly dressed so as to save time afterwards. He had \\njust slipped into a fresh shirt when there was a knock on the \\ndoor. He reasoned quickly that Mike had tried to get him on \\nthe phone and had kept getting a busy signal so had simply \\nsent a messenger to call him. Carlo went to the door and opened \\nit. He felt his whole body go weak with a terrible sickening \\nfear. Standing in the doorway was Michael Corleone, his face \\nthe face of that death Carlo Rizzi saw often in his dreams. \\n\\nBehind Michael Corleone were Hagen and Rocco Lampone. \\nThey looked grave, like pe<^le who had come with the utmost \\nreluctance to give a ftiend bad news. The three of them entered \\nthe house and Carlo Rizzi led them into the living room. \\n\\n\\n457 \\n\\n\\n\\nRecovered from his first shock, he thought that he had suffered \\nan attack of nerves. Michael^s words made him really sick, \\nphysically nauseous. \\n\\n‘You have to answer for Santino,’ Michael said. \\n\\nCarlo didn’t answer, pretended not to understand. Hagen \\nand Lampone had split away to opposite walls of the room. He \\nand Michael faced each other. \\n\\n‘You fingered Sonny for the Bartini people,’ Michael said, \\nhis voice flat. ‘That little farce you played out with my. sister, \\ndid Bar2ini kid you that would fool a Corleone?’ \\n\\nCarlo Rizzi spoke out of his terrible fear, without dignity, \\nwithout any kind of pride. ‘I swear I*m innocent. I swear on \\nthe head of my children I’m innocent. Mike, don’t do this to \\nme, please, Mike, don’t do this to me.’ \\n\\nMichael said quietly, ‘Barzini is dead. So is Phillip Tattaglia. \\nI want to square all the Family accounts tonight. So don’t tell \\nme you’re innocent. It would be better for you to admit what \\nyou did.’ \\n\\nHagen and Lampone stared at Michael with astonishment. \\nThey were thinking that Michael was not yet the man his \\nfather was. Why try to get this traitor to admit guilt? That \\nguilt was already proven as much as such a thing could be \\nproven. The answer was obvious. Michael still was not that \\nconfident of his right, still feared being unjust, still worried \\nabout that fraction of an uncertainty that only a confession by \\nCarlo Rizzi could erase. \\n\\nThere was still no answer. Michael said almost kindly, \\n‘Don’t be so frightened. Do you think I’d make my sister a \\nwi^ow? Do you think I’d make my nephews fatherless? After \\nall I’m Godftther to one of your kids. No, your punishment \\nwill be that you won’t be allowed any work with the Family. \\nI’m putting you on a plane to Vegas to join your wife and kids \\nand then I want you to stay there. I’ll send Connie an allow- \\nance. That’s all. But don’t keep saying you’re innocent, don’t \\ninsult my intelligence and make me angry. Who approached \\nyou, Tattaglia or Barzini?’ \\n\\nCarlo Rizzi in his anguished hope for life, in the sweet \\nflooding relief that he was not going to be killed, murmured, \\n‘Barzini.’ \\n\\n\\n438 \\n\\n\\n\\n*Good, good/ Michael said softly. He beckoned with his \\nright hand. ‘ I want you to leave now. There’s a car waiting to \\ntake you to the airport.’ \\n\\nCarlo went out the door first, the other three men very close \\nto him. It was night now, but the mall as usual was bright with \\nfioodlights. A car pulled up. Carlo saw it was his own car. He \\ndidn’t recognize the driver. There was someone sitting in the \\nback but on the far side. Lampone opened the front door and \\nmotioned to Carlo to get in. Michael said, \\'I’ll call your wife \\nand tell her you’re on your way down.’ Carlo got into the car. \\nHis silk shirt was soaked with sweat. \\n\\nThe car pulled away, moving swiftly towards the gate. Carlo \\nstarted to turn his head to see if he knew the man sitting behind \\nhim. At that moment, Clemenza, as cunningly and daintily as a \\nlittle girl slipping a ribbon over the head of a kitten, threw his \\ngarrotte around Carlo Rizzi’s neck. The smooth rope cut into \\nthe skin with Clemenza’s powerful yanking throttle. Carlo \\nRizzi’s body went leaping into the air like a fish on a line, but \\nClemenza held him fast, tightening the garrotte until the body \\nwent slack. Suddenly there was a foul odour in the air of the \\ncar. Carlo’s body, sphincter released by approaching death, \\nhad voided itself, Clemenza kept the garrotte tight for another \\nfew minutes to make sure, then released the rope and put \\nit back in his pocket. He relaxed himself against the scat \\ncushions as Carlo’s body slumped against the door. After a few \\nmoments Clemenza rolled the window down to let out the \\nstink. \\n\\nThe victory of the Corleone Family was complete. During \\nthat same twenty-four-hour period Clemenza and Lampone \\nturned loose their re^mes and punished the infiltrators of the \\nCorleone domains. Ncri was sent to take command of the \\nTessio regime. Barzini bookmakers were put out of business; \\ntwo of the highest-ranking Barzini enforcers were shot to \\ndeath as they were peaceably picking their teeth over dinner in \\nan Italian restaurant on Miilberry Street. A notorious fixer of \\ntrotting races was also killed as he returned home from a win- \\nning night at the track. Two of the biggest shylocks on the \\nwaterfront disappeared, to be found months later in the New \\nJersey swamps. \\n\\n\\n459 \\n\\n\\n\\nWith this one savage attack, Michael G^rleone made his \\nreputation and restored the Corleone Family to its primary \\nplace in the New York Families. He was respected not only \\nfor his tactical brilliance but because some of the most im- \\nportant caporegimes in both the Barzini and Tattaglia Families \\nimmediately went over to his side. \\n\\nIt would have been a perfect triumph for Michael Corleone \\nexcept for an exhibition of hysteria by his sister Connie. \\n\\nConnie had flown home with her mother, the children left in \\nVegas. She had restrained her widow’s grief until the limousine \\npulled into the mall. Then, before she could be restrained by \\nher mother, she ran across the cobbled street to Michael Cot- \\nleone’s house. She burst through the door and found Michael \\nand Kay in the living room. Kay started to go to her, to com- \\nfort her and take her in her arms in a sisterly embrace but \\nstopped short when Connie started screaming at her brother, \\nscreaming curses and reproaches. ‘You lousy bastard,’ she \\nshrieked. ‘You killed my husband. You waited until our father \\ndied and nobody could stop you and you killed him. You \\nkilled him. You blamed him about Sonny, you always did, \\neverybody did. But you never thought about me. You never \\ngave a damn about me. What am I going to do now, what am I \\ngoing to do?’ She was wailing. Two of Michael’s bodyguards \\nhad come up behind her and were waiting for orders from \\nhim. But he just stood there impassively and waited for his \\nsister to finish. \\n\\nKay said in a shocked voice, ‘Connie, you’re upset, don’t \\nsay such things.’ \\n\\nConnie had recovered from her hysteria. Her voice held a \\ndeadly venom. ‘Why do you think he was always so cold to \\nme? Why do you think he kept Carlo here on the mall? All the \\ntime he knew he was going to kill my husband. But he didn’t \\ndare while my father was alive. My father would have stopped \\nhim. He knew that. He was just waiting. And then he stood \\nGodfather to our child just to throw us ofl* the track. The cold- \\nhearted bastard. You think you know your husband? Do you \\nknow how many men he had killed with my Carlo? Just read \\nthe papers. Barzini and Tattaglia and the o^ers. My brother \\nhad them killc^.’ \\n\\n\\n440 \\n\\n\\n\\nShe had worked herself into hysteria again. She tried to spit \\nin Michael’s face but she had no saliva. \\n\\n‘Get her home and get her a doctor/ Michael said. The two \\nguards immediately grabbed G>nnie’s arms and pulled her out \\nof the house. \\n\\nKay was still shocked, still horrified. She said to her hus- \\nband, ‘What made her say all those things, Michael, what \\nmakes her believe that?* \\n\\nMichael shrugged. ‘ She’s hysterical.’ \\n\\nKay looked into his eyes. ‘Michael, it’s not true, please say \\nit’s not true.’ \\n\\nMichael shook his head wearily. ‘Of course it’s not. Just \\nbelieve me, this one time I’m letting you ask about my affairs, \\nand I’m giving you an answer. It is not true.’ He had never \\nbeen more convincing. He looked directly into her eyes. He \\nwas using all the mutual trust they had built up in their married \\nlife to make her believe him. And she could not doubt any \\nlonger. She smiled at him ruefully and came into liis arms for \\na kiss. \\n\\n‘We both need a drink,’ she said. She went into the kitchen \\nfor ice and while there heard the front door open. She went \\nout of the kitchen and saw Qemenza, Neri, and Rocco Lam- \\npone come in with the bodyguards. Michael had his back to \\nher, but she moved so that she could see him in profile. At that \\nmoment Clemenaa addressed her husband, greeting him for- \\nmaUy. \\n\\n‘Don Michael,’ Qiemenza said. \\n\\nKay could sec how Michael stood to receive their homage. \\nHe reminded her of statues in Rome, statues of tl^ose Roman \\nemperors of antiquity, who, by divine right, held the power of \\nlife and death over their fellow men. One hand was on his hip, \\nthe profile of his face showed a cold proud power, hk body \\nwas carelessly, arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one foot \\nslightly behind the other. The caporeffmes stood before him. \\nIn that moment Kay knew that everything Connie had accused \\nMichael of was true. She went back into the kitchen and wept. \\n\\n\\n441 \\n\\n\\n\\nBook IX \\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-TWO \\n\\n\\nThe fi LOODT victory of the Corleone Family was not com- \\nplete until a year of delicate political manoeuvring established \\nMichael Corleone as the most powerful Family chief in the \\nUnited States. For twelve months, Michael divided his time \\nequally between his headquarters at the Long Beach mall and \\nhis new home in Las Vegas. But at the end of that year he \\ndecided to close out the New York operation and sell the \\nhouses and the mall property. For that purpose he brought his \\nwhole family East on a last visit. They would stay a month, \\nwind up business, Kay would do the personal family’s packing \\nand shipping of household goods. There were a million other \\nminor details. \\n\\nNow the Corleone Family was unchallengeable, and Qem- \\nenza had his own Family. Rocco Lampone was the Corleone \\nfaporeffme. In Nevada, Albert Neri was head of all security for \\nthe Family-controlled hotels. Hagen, too, was part of Michael’s \\nWestern Family. \\n\\nTime helped heal the old wounds. Connie Corleone was \\nreconciled to her brother Michael. Indeed not more than a \\nweek after her terrible accusations she apologized to Michael \\nfor what she had said and assured Kay t^t there had been no \\ntfuth in her words, that it had been only a young widow’s \\nhysteria. \\n\\nConnie Corleone easily found a new husband; in fact, she \\ndid not wait the year of respect before filling her bed again \\nwith a fine young fellow who had come to work for the Cor- \\nleone Family as a male secretary. A boy fn>m a reliable Italian \\nfamily but graduated from the top business college in America. \\nNaturally his marriage to the sister of the Don made his future \\nassured. \\n\\nKay Adams Corleone had delighted her in-laws by taking \\n\\n\\n442 \\n\\n\\n\\ninstruction in the Githolic religion and joining that faith. Her \\ntwo boys were also, naturally, being brought up in •‘Hat- \\nchurch, as was required. Michael himself had not been too \\npleased by this development. He would have preferred the \\nchildren to be Protestant, k was more American. \\n\\nTo her surprise, Kay came to love living m Nevada. She \\nloved the scenery, the hills and canyons of garishly red rock, \\nthe burning deserts, the unexpected and blessedly refreshing \\nlakes, even the heat. Her two boys rode their own ponies. She \\nhad real servants, not bodyguards. And Michael lived a more \\nnormal life. He owned a construction business ; he joined the \\nbusinessmen\\'s clubs and civic committees; he had a healthy \\ninterest in local politics without interfering publicly. It was a \\ngood life. Kay was happy that they were dosing down their \\nNew York house and that Las Vegas would be truly their \\npermanent home. She hated coming back to New York. And \\nso on this last trip she had arranged all the packing and shipping \\nof goods with the utmost efficiency and speed, and now on \\nthe final day she felt that same urgency to leave that long- \\ntime patients feel when it is time to be discharged from the \\nhospital. \\n\\nOn that final day, Kay Adams Corleone woke at dawn. She \\ncould hear the roar of the truck motors outside on the mall. \\nThe trucks that would empty all the houses of furniture. The \\nCorleone Family would be Hying back to Las Vegas in the \\nafternoon, induding Mama Corleone. \\n\\nWhen Kay came out of the bathroom, Michael was propped \\nup on his pillow smoking a cigarette. *Why the hell do you \\nhave to go to church wery morning?^ he said. *1. don’t mind \\nSundays, but why the hell during the week? You’re as bad as \\nmy motlicr.* He reached over in the darkness and switched on \\nthe tablelight. \\n\\nKay sat at the edge of the bed to pull up her stockings. * You \\nknow how converted Catholics are,’ she said. ‘They take it \\nmore seriously.’ \\n\\nMichael reached over to touch her thigh, on the warm skin \\nwhere the top of her nylon hose ended. ‘Don’t,* she said. ‘I’m \\ntaking Communion this morning.’ \\n\\nHe didn’t try to hold her when she got up from the bed. He \\n\\n\\n445 \\n\\n\\n\\nsaid, smiling slightly, *If you’re such a strict Catholic, how come \\nyou let the kids duck going to church so much?’ \\n\\nShe felt uncomfortable and she was wary. He was studying \\nher with what she thought of privately as his ‘Don’s’ eye. \\n‘ They have plenty of time,’ she said. ‘ When we get back home, \\n1*11 make them attend more.’ \\n\\nShe kissed him goodbye before she left. Outside the house \\nthe air was already getting warm. The summer sun rising in the \\neast was red. Kay walked to where her car was parked near the \\ngates of the mall. Mama Corleone, dressed in her widow black, \\nwas already sitting it it, waiting for her. It had become a set \\nroutine, early Mass, every morning, together. \\n\\nKay kissed the old woman’s wrinkled cheek, then got behind \\nthe wheel. Mama Corleone asked suspiciously, ‘You eata \\nbreakfast?’ \\n\\n‘No,’ Kay said. \\n\\nThe old woman nodded her head approvingly. Kay had \\nonce forgotten that it was forbidden to take food from mid- \\nnight on before receiving Holy Communion. That had been a \\nlong time ago, but Mama Corleone never trusted her after that \\nand always checked. ‘ You feel all right? ’ the old woman asked. \\n\\n‘Yes,’ said Kay. \\n\\nThe church was small and desolate in the early morning sun- \\nlight. Its stained-glass windows shielded the interior from heat, \\nit would be cool there, a place to rest. Kay helped her mother- \\nin-law up the white stone steps and then let her go before her. \\nThe old woman preferred a pew up front, close to the altar. \\nKay waited on the steps for an extra minute. She was always \\nreluctant at this last moment, always a little fearful. \\n\\nTinally she entered the cool darkness. She took the holy \\nwater on her fingertips and made the sign of the cross, fleet- \\ningly touched her wet fingertips to her parched lips. Gandies \\nflickered redly before the saints, the Christ on his cross. Kay \\ngenuflected before entering her row and then knelt on the \\nhard wooden rail of the pew to wait for her call to Communion. \\nShe bowed her head as if she were praying, but she was not \\nquite ready for that. \\n\\nIt was only here in these dim, vaulted churches that she \\n\\n\\n\\nallowed herself to think about her husband’s other life. About \\nthat terrible night a year ago when he had deliberately used all \\ntheir trust and love in each other to make her believe his lie \\nthat he had not killed his sister’s husband. \\n\\nShe had left him because of that lie, not because of the deed. \\nThe next morning she had taken the children away with her \\nto her parents’ house in New Hampshire. Without a word to \\niiT^yone, without really knowing what action she meant to take. \\nNiichacl had immediately understood. He had called her the \\nfirst day and then left her alone. It was a week before the \\nlimousine from New York pulled up in front of her house with \\nTom Hagen. \\n\\nShe had spent a long terrible afternoon with Tom Hagen, \\nthe most terrible afternoon of her life. They had gone for a \\nwalk in the woods outside her little town and Hagen had not \\nbeen gentle. \\n\\nKay had made the mistake of trying to be cruelly flippant, a \\nrole to which she was not suited. ‘ Did Mike send you up here \\nto threaten me?’ she asked. *1 expected to see some of the \\n“boys ” get out of the car with their machine guns to make me \\ngo back.’ \\n\\nFor the first time since she had known him, she saw Hagen \\nangry. He said harshly, * That’s the worst kind of juvenile crap \\nI’ve ever heard. I never expected that from a woman like you. \\nCome on, Kay.’ \\n\\n*A11 right,’ she said. \\n\\nThey walked along the green coxmtry road. Hagen asked \\nquietly, ‘Why did you run away?’ \\n\\nKay said, ‘Because Michael lied to me. Because he made a \\nfool of me when he stood Godfather to Connie’s boy. He \\nbetrayed me. I can’t love a man like that. I can’t live with it. \\nI can’t let him be father to my children.’ \\n\\n‘I don’t know what you’re talking about,’ Hagen said. \\n\\nShe turned on him with now-justified rage. ‘I mean that he \\nkilled his sister’s husband. Do you understand that?’ She \\npaused for a moment. ‘And he lied to me.’ \\n\\nThey walked on for a long time in silence. Finally Hagen \\nsaid, ‘You have no way of really knowing that’s all true. But \\njust for the sake of argument let’s assume that it’s true. I’m \\n\\n\\n445 \\n\\n\\n\\nhot saying it is, remember. But what if I gave you what might \\nbe some justification for what he did. Or rather some possible \\njustifications?’ \\n\\nKay looked at him scornfully. * That’s the first time I’ve \\nseen the lawyer side of you, Tom. It’s not your best side.* \\n\\nHagen grinned. *OK. Just hear me out. What if Carlo had \\nput Sonny on the spot, fingered him. What if Carlo beating up \\nConnie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out in the \\nopen, that they knew he would take the route over the Jones \\nBeach Causeway? What if Carlo had been paid to help get \\nSonny killed? Then what?’ \\n\\nKay didn’t answer. Hagen went on. ‘And what if the Don, \\na great man, couldn’t bring himself to do what he had to do, \\navenge his son’s death by killing his daughter’s husband? \\nWhat if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made \\nMichael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that \\nload off his shoulders, would take that guilt?’ \\n\\n‘ It was all over with,’ Kay said, tears springing into her eyes. \\n‘ Everybody was happy. Why couldn’t Carlo be forgiven? \\\\^y \\ncouldn’t everything go on and everybody forget?’ \\n\\nShe had led across a meadow to a tree~shaded brook. Hagen \\nsank down on the grass and sighed. He looked around, sighed \\nagain and said, ‘In this world you could do it.’ \\n\\nKay said, ‘He’s not the man I married.’ \\n\\nHagen laughed shortly. ‘If he were, he’d be dead now. \\nYou’d be a widow now. You’d have no problem.’ \\n\\nKay blazed out at him. ‘What the hell does that mean? \\nCome on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life. I know \\nMichael can’t, but you’re not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the \\ntruth, you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.’ \\n\\nThere was another long silence. Hagen shook his head. \\n‘You’ve got Mike wrong. You’re mad because he lied to you. \\nWell, he warned you never to ask him about business. You’re \\nmad because he was Godfather to Carlo’s boy. But you made \\nhim do that. Actually it was the right move for him to make \\nif he was going to take action against Carlo. The classical \\ntactical move to win the victim’s trust.’ Hagen gave her a \\ngrim smile. ‘Is that straight enough talk for you?’ But Kay \\nhad bowed her head. \\n\\n\\n446 \\n\\n\\n\\nHagen went on. *1^11 give you some more straight talk. \\nAfitcr the Don died, Mike was set up to be killed. Do you \\nknow who set him up? Tessio. So Tessio had to be killed. \\nCarlo had to be killed. Because treachery can’t be forgiven. \\nMichael could have forgiven it, but people never forgive \\nthemselves and so they would always be dangerous. Michael \\nreally liked Tessio. He loves his sister. But he would be shirking \\nhis duty to you and his children, to his whole family, to me and \\nmy family, if he let Tessio and Carlo go free. They would have \\nbeen a danger to us all, all our lives.’ \\n\\nKay had been listening to this with tears running down her \\nface. ‘Is that what Michael sent you up here to tell me?’ \\n\\nHagen looked at her in genuine surprise. ‘No,’ he said. ‘He \\ntold me to tell you you could have everything you want and do \\neverything you want as long as you take good care of the \\nkids.’ Hagen smiled. ‘He said to tell you that you’re his Don. \\nThat’s just a joke.* \\n\\nKay put her hand on Hagen*s arm. ‘ He didn’t order you to \\ntell me all the other things?’ \\n\\nHagen hesitated a moment as if debating whether to tell her \\na final truth. ‘ You still don’t understand,’ he said. ‘If you told \\nMichael what I’ve told you today, I’m a dead man.’ He paused \\nagain. ‘You and the children are the only people on this earth \\nhe couldn’t harm,’ \\n\\nIt was a long five minutes after that Kay rose from the grass \\nand they started walking back to the house. When they were \\nalmost there, Kay said to Hagen, ‘After supper, can you drive \\nme and the kids to New York in your car?’ \\n\\n‘That’s what I came for,* Hagen said. \\n\\nA week after she returned to l^chael she went t® a priest for \\ninstruction to become a Catholic. \\n\\nFrom the innermost recess of the church the bell tolled for \\nrepentance. As she had been taught to do, Kay struck her \\nbreast lightly with her clenched hand, the stroke of repentance. \\nThe bell tolled again and there was the shuffling of feet as the \\ncommunicants left their seats to go to the altar tail. Kay rose \\nto join them. She knelt at the altar and ftom the depths of the \\nchurch the bell tolled again. With her dosed hand she struck \\n\\n\\n447 \\n\\n\\n\\n/ber heart once more. 1 he priest was before her. She tilted back \\nher head and opened her mouth to receive the papery thin \\nwafer. This was the most terrible moment of aU. Until it \\nmelted away and she could swallow and she could do what she \\ncame to do. \\n\\nWashed clean of sin, a favoured supplicant, she bowed her \\nhead and folded her hands over the altar rail. She shifted her \\nbody to make her weight less punishing to her knees. \\n\\nShe emptied her mind of all thought of herself, of her chil- \\ndren, of all anger, of all rebellion, of all questions. Then with \\na profound and deeply willed desire to bdieve, to be heard, as \\nshe had done every day since the murder of Carlo Ri22i, she \\nsaid the necessary prayers for the soul of Michael Corlconc. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
